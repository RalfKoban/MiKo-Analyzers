# MiKo_2302: Remove commented-out code

## Cause

Code contains commented-out code blocks that should be removed.

## Rule description

The longer code remains commented out, the more likely it becomes outdated and un-compilable.
Since code should be committed to Source Control Systems, developers can rely on the SCS history to retrieve older versions if needed.
Therefore, there is no need to keep commented-out code in the codebase, keeping the code clean and maintainable.

### Rationale behind

Commented-out code creates confusion and uncertainty.
Developers encountering it do not know if it should be preserved, re-enabled, or deleted.
Modern version control systems make commented-out code completely unnecessary.

Removing commented-out code provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Confusion**:
  When developers see commented-out code, they wonder why it is there and whether it might be needed.
  This creates uncertainty and wastes time investigating.

- **Prevents Code Rot**:
  Commented-out code is not maintained or updated as the codebase evolves.
  Over time, it becomes incompatible with the current codebase and misleading.

- **Reduces Clutter**:
  Commented-out code takes up space and makes files longer without providing any value.
  Removing it makes code cleaner and easier to navigate.

- **Leverages Version Control**:
  Version control systems preserve all historical versions of code.
  If old code is needed, it can be retrieved from history.
  There is no need to keep it in comments.

- **Improves Readability**:
  Code files are easier to read and understand when they only contain active, functional code.
  Commented-out sections distract from the actual implementation.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers should not need to wonder about commented-out code or whether it should be removed.
  Clean code makes reviews more efficient.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove commented-out code blocks.
If the code might be needed in the future, rely on version control history to retrieve it.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2302
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2302
```
