# MiKo_1080: Use numbers instead of their spellings in names

## Cause

A name contains the spelling of a number instead of the number itself.

## Rule description

Numbers inside names are much easier to read when written as digits rather than spelled out.
For example, `issue42` is clearer than `issueFortyTwo`.

### Rationale behind

Spelled-out numbers in names make code harder to read and understand.
When numbers are written as digits, developers can quickly grasp the meaning without having to mentally convert words to numbers.

Using numeric digits instead of spelled-out numbers provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Digits are instantly recognizable and easier to read at a glance.
  Developers do not have to mentally convert words like `TwentyFive` to the actual number 25.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Spelled-out numbers can be confusing or misread, especially for larger numbers.
  Using digits eliminates any confusion about the intended value.

- **Consistency**:
  Most code uses numeric digits for numbers in names, so following this convention makes the codebase more consistent and predictable.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  Reading `500` is much faster than reading `FiveHundred`, especially when scanning through code quickly.

- **Language Independence**:
  Digits are universal and do not depend on language, making code more accessible to international development teams.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the spelling of the number with the number itself.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1080
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1080
```
