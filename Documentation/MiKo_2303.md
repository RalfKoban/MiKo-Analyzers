# MiKo_2303: Do not end comments with a period

## Cause

An inline comment ends with a period.

## Rule description

Inline comments are meant for team members, unlike API documentation.
They should be concise and to the point, not full sentences or paragraphs.
This emphasis on brevity helps maintain clarity within the team, keeping communication streamlined and effective.

This rule contradicts MiKo_2306.

### Rationale behind

The question of whether to end comments with periods is a stylistic choice that teams must decide.
Some teams prefer brief, fragmentary comments without periods, while others prefer complete sentences with proper punctuation.
This rule supports the brief comment style.

Not ending comments with periods provides several benefits for teams that prefer this style:

- **Emphasizes Brevity**:
  Omitting periods signals that comments should be brief notes rather than complete sentences.
  This encourages developers to keep comments concise.

- **Faster Writing**:
  Not worrying about punctuation allows developers to write comments more quickly.
  The focus is on conveying information, not grammatical correctness.

- **Consistent Style**:
  When all inline comments follow the same style (no periods), the codebase has a consistent appearance.
  This makes it easier to distinguish between different types of comments.

- **Clear Distinction from Documentation**:
  API documentation uses complete sentences with proper punctuation.
  Inline comments without periods are visually distinct, making their different purpose clear.

- **Reduced Noise**:
  Periods at the end of short comments can appear as visual clutter.
  Removing them makes comments feel lighter and less formal.

- **Team Convention**:
  Following a consistent team convention, whether it includes periods or not, is more important than the specific choice.
  This rule helps enforce one such convention.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove periods from the end of inline comments.
