# MiKo_2018: Do not use ambiguous terms `Check` or `Test` in documentation

## Cause

Documentation uses ambiguous terms like `Check` or `Test` that do not precisely describe what the method does.

## Rule description

Terms like `Check` or `Test` can be vague.
When validating parameters, use `Validates`.
When verifying something, use `Verifies`.
If the method needs to determine some condition or situation, use `Determines whether.`
This ensures clarity and precision in the code.

### Rationale behind

Vague terms like `Check` and `Test` do not clearly communicate what action a method performs.
Using precise verbs eliminates ambiguity and helps developers immediately understand the method's purpose.

Using precise terminology provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Method Purpose**:
  Specific verbs like `Validates`, `Verifies`, and `Determines` precisely describe what the method does.
  Developers can understand the method's behavior immediately without reading the implementation.

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  The word `Check` can mean many things: validate, verify, inspect, examine, or test.
  Precise verbs remove this ambiguity and provide clear information.

- **Consistent Patterns**:
  Using standard verbs creates consistent documentation patterns throughout the codebase.
  Similar methods use similar documentation, making the API easier to learn and use.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When developers see precise verbs in IntelliSense, they immediately understand what the method does.
  This speeds up development and reduces the need to look at detailed documentation.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework uses precise verbs in its documentation.
  Following the same approach creates consistency with framework APIs.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Precise, unambiguous language makes documentation appear more professional and well-crafted.
  This reflects positively on the overall quality of the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace ambiguous terms with precise verbs.

Use `Validates` when the method checks parameter validity, `Verifies` when confirming something is true, and `Determines whether` when checking a condition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2018
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2018
```
