# MiKo_6067: Place ternary operators on same lines as their respective expressions

## Cause

The `?` and `:` tokens of ternary operators are not placed at the start of their respective expression lines.

## Rule description

Placing the `?` and `:` tokens of the ternary operator at the start of their respective lines in multi-line ternary expressions improves readability, visual structure, and code scanning.
This style avoids dangling operators, aligns with common C# style guides and tooling, and makes complex logic easier to parse and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Proper positioning of ternary operators is crucial for maintaining readable and maintainable code, especially when expressions span multiple lines.
When the `?` and `:` operators are placed at the start of their respective expression lines, it creates a clear visual structure that makes the conditional logic easy to understand and follow.

Placing ternary operators on the same lines as their respective expressions provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Clarity**:
  Starting each branch with its operator makes the structure of the ternary expression immediately visible.
  The operators act as visual markers that clearly delineate the condition, true branch, and false branch.

- **Better Scanability**:
  When operators are at the start of lines, developers can quickly scan vertically to see the structure of the ternary expression.
  The consistent positioning makes it easy to identify all parts of the conditional.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Placing operators at the start prevents them from being lost at the end of long expression lines.
  This eliminates confusion about where one branch ends and another begins.

- **Alignment with Standards**:
  This style aligns with common C# coding standards and is supported by most code formatting tools.
  Following these standards makes the codebase consistent with industry practices.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When each branch is clearly marked with its operator, debugging ternary expressions becomes simpler.
  Developers can easily identify which branch is being evaluated or causing issues.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Clear operator positioning makes it easier to modify ternary expressions.
  Adding or changing branches is less error-prone when the structure is visually obvious.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the `?` and `:` operators at the start of their respective expression lines.
Ensure each operator leads its corresponding branch, creating a clear vertical alignment.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6067
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6067
```
