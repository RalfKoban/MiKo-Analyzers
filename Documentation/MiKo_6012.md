# MiKo_6012: Surround foreach loops with blank lines

## Cause

`foreach` loops are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `foreach` loops with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `foreach` loops with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code structure and improving readability.
Loops represent iterative operations that are distinct from sequential code execution, and visually separating them helps developers understand where iteration begins and how it relates to the surrounding logic.

Surrounding foreach loops with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Iteration Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `foreach` loops stand out as iterative operations.
  Developers can immediately identify where collection iteration occurs in the code.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When loops are visually separated, the code logic is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal a transition from sequential operations to iterative processing.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into logical sections.
  Loop logic is clearly distinguished from the surrounding sequential code.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Visually distinct loops are easier to locate when navigating through code.
  Developers can quickly find iterative operations without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated loops are easier to work with during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify loop boundaries and set breakpoints appropriately.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When `foreach` loops are clearly separated, modifying iterative logic is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where the loop begins and ends.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `foreach` loops.
Ensure each loop is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6012
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6012
```
