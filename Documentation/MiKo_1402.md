# MiKo_1402: Do not name namespaces after WPF-specific design patterns

## Cause

A namespace name includes WPF-specific technical concepts like `Command`, `Commands`, `Model`, `Models`, `View`, `Views`, `ViewModel`, `ViewModels`, or `MVVM`.

## Rule description

Namespaces should not include WPF-specific technical concepts as they are implementation details.
Focus on the business or functional domain instead.

### Rationale behind

Including WPF-specific technical concepts in namespaces creates unnecessary coupling to implementation details that may change over time.
When code is organized around technical MVVM/WPF concepts, a single functionality gets scattered across multiple namespaces (such as `Models`, `Views`, `ViewModels`, `Commands`, ...).
This makes the codebase harder to maintain and understand.

Avoiding WPF-specific technical concepts in namespaces provides several important benefits:

- **Business-Focused Organization**:
  Namespaces organized by business domain or functional purpose remain stable regardless of architectural approach.
  This prevents the need for extensive reorganization when UI patterns or frameworks change.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Code organization based on what it does rather than how it is structured makes the codebase more maintainable.
  Developers can find functionality based on business purpose, not WPF implementation patterns.

- **Reduced Code Base Cluttering**:
  When types are organized by WPF technical/conceptual namespaces, a single functionality gets scattered across multiple namespaces (such as `Models`, `Views`, `ViewModels`, `Commands`).
  Avoiding those conceptual namespaces keeps the types together that belong together, resulting in much less cluttering of the code base.
  All components of a specific feature or domain remain co-located, making them easier to understand, modify, and maintain as a cohesive unit.

- **Improved Adaptability**:
  The codebase becomes more adaptable to future UI framework changes.
  Switching from WPF to other UI frameworks or adopting different patterns does not require namespace restructuring.

- **Enhanced Code Discoverability**:
  Developers can find code based on functional purpose rather than MVVM/WPF patterns.
  This makes navigation more intuitive and efficient, especially for developers less familiar with MVVM.

- **Domain-Driven Design Alignment**:
  Domain-focused namespaces align better with Domain-Driven Design principles.
  This makes it easier to maintain a clear separation between business logic and UI concerns.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the namespace to focus on business or functional domain rather than WPF technical implementation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1402
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1402
```
