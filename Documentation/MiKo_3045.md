# MiKo_3045: Use `nameof` for EventManager event registrations

## Cause

Event registration with `EventManager` uses a string literal instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

Use the `nameof` operator for event names registered on the `EventManager` instead of strings.
This prevents typos, ensures valid names, and makes rename refactoring much easier, as `nameof` ensures property names are automatically updated during renames, unlike strings.

### Rationale behind

WPF's EventManager provides centralized event routing and registration.
Like WeakEventManager, it requires event names to be specified as strings, which creates opportunities for errors.

Using `nameof` with EventManager provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Verification**:
  The compiler ensures that referenced events actually exist.
  String literals can contain typos or reference deleted events, causing registration failures at runtime.

- **Refactoring Support**:
  When events are renamed, `nameof` expressions are automatically updated by refactoring tools.
  String literals must be manually found and updated, which is error-prone.

- **IntelliSense Assistance**:
  Developers get autocomplete suggestions when using `nameof`.
  String literals provide no IDE support, requiring manual typing of event names.

- **Early Detection**:
  Problems with event registration are caught at compile time.
  Runtime errors in event routing can be difficult to diagnose and reproduce.

- **Code Navigation**:
  "Go to Definition" works with `nameof`, allowing quick navigation to event definitions.
  String literals do not support navigation features.

- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**:
  Changes to event names are automatically reflected in registration code.
  This eliminates the need to search for string literals that might have been missed during refactoring.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace string literals with the `nameof` operator.
Change `EventManager.RegisterClassHandler(typeof(MyClass), "EventName", handler)` to use `nameof` for the event name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3045
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3045
```
