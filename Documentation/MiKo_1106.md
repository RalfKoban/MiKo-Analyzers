# MiKo_1106: Name one-time test cleanup methods `CleanupTestEnvironment`

## Cause

A one-time test teardown method is not named `CleanupTestEnvironment`.

## Rule description

One-time test teardown methods (marked with `[OneTimeTearDown]` or similar attributes) should be consistently named `CleanupTestEnvironment` to clearly indicate their purpose and improve readability.

### Rationale behind

Using a consistent name for one-time test teardown methods is important for test code readability and maintainability.

Naming all one-time test teardown methods `CleanupTestEnvironment` provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  Developers can instantly recognize one-time teardown methods across all test classes without having to check attributes or read method bodies.
  This standardization reduces cognitive load when navigating test code.

- **Clear Scope Distinction**:
  The name `CleanupTestEnvironment` clearly indicates that this method runs once after all tests in the fixture complete, not after each individual test.
  This distinction from `CleanupTest` helps prevent confusion about when the cleanup logic executes.

- **Symmetry with Setup**:
  Using `CleanupTestEnvironment` pairs naturally with `PrepareTestEnvironment`, creating a clear symmetry that makes the test lifecycle easier to understand.

- **Consistent Team Standards**:
  A uniform naming convention ensures all team members follow the same pattern, making code reviews easier and reducing debates about naming choices.

- **Better Resource Management**:
  Clear naming helps ensure that expensive or shared resources are properly cleaned up after all tests complete, reducing the risk of resource leaks or side effects affecting other test fixtures.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all one-time teardown methods have the same name, it is easier to find and modify cleanup logic across multiple test classes.
  This consistency speeds up maintenance tasks.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the one-time test teardown method to `CleanupTestEnvironment`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1106
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1106
