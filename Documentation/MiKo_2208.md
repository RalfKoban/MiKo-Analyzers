# MiKo_2208: Do not use term `an instance of` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses the phrase `an instance of` instead of providing a more meaningful description.

## Rule description

Documentation should use a more meaningful description than `an instance of`.
A concrete description helps developers better understand the meaning.
Clear and specific language enhances comprehension and usability.

### Rationale behind

The phrase `an instance of` is technically correct but provides minimal information about the purpose or meaning of a type or variable.
It merely restates what is already obvious from the type declaration.

Documentation should explain what something represents in the context of the application, not just state its type.
Describing the role, purpose, or meaning provides much more value to developers reading the documentation.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **More Meaningful Documentation**:
  Describing what something represents is more useful than stating it is an instance of a type.

- **Better Context**:
  Contextual descriptions help developers understand how to use types and members correctly.

- **Improved Understanding**:
  Clear descriptions of purpose and meaning make APIs easier to learn and use.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Avoiding repetition of type information that is already visible makes documentation more valuable.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Thoughtful descriptions demonstrate care in API design and documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `an instance of` with a description that explains what the type or variable represents in the application context.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2208
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2208
```
