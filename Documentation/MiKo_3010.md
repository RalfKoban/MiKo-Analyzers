# MiKo_3010: Do not create or throw reserved exception types

## Cause

Code creates or throws an exception type that is reserved for the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

## Rule description

Certain exceptions are reserved for and thrown by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and often signal bugs.
Developers should not throw these exceptions themselves to maintain code cleanliness and avoid confusion.
Following this principle ensures clear and robust code management.

### Rationale behind

Reserved exception types have specific meanings within the .NET runtime and are intended to signal critical runtime errors.
When application code throws these exceptions, it obscures the true source of problems and makes debugging more difficult.

Avoiding reserved exception types provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Error Sources**:
  When reserved exceptions appear, developers know they indicate runtime or framework issues.
  Application code throwing these exceptions creates confusion about where problems originate.

- **Better Debugging**:
  Runtime exceptions typically indicate serious bugs that need immediate attention.
  Throwing them from application code dilutes their significance and makes real issues harder to spot.

- **Improved Code Quality**:
  Using appropriate exception types for specific scenarios leads to better error handling.
  Each exception type should have a clear purpose and meaning.

- **Easier Troubleshooting**:
  When runtime exceptions only come from the runtime, stack traces point directly to the problem.
  Application-thrown runtime exceptions create false leads during troubleshooting.

- **Better Exception Handling**:
  Catch blocks designed for runtime exceptions expect specific failure scenarios.
  Application code throwing these exceptions can trigger inappropriate error handling.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use [a more appropriate exception type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/using-standard-exception-types) for the specific error condition, such as `InvalidOperationException`, `ArgumentException`, or create a custom exception type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3010
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3010
```
