# MiKo_2244: Use `<list>` instead of `<ul>` or `<ol>` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation uses HTML tags like `<ul>` or `<ol>` instead of the proper XML documentation tag `<list>`.

## Rule description

XML documentation should use the `<list>` tag for enumerating items.
Avoid using `<ul>` or `<ol>` because IntelliSense and XML documentation tools cannot recognize these and may format comments awkwardly.
Using `<list>` allows IntelliSense to format content as tables, numbered lists, ordered lists, and more, making documentation clear and easy to read.

### Rationale behind

HTML tags like `<ul>` and `<ol>` are not part of the XML documentation standard for .NET.
Using them means documentation tools cannot properly parse and format the content, resulting in poor presentation.

Using `<list>` instead of HTML list tags provides several important benefits:

- **Proper IntelliSense Rendering**:
  IntelliSense knows how to format `<list>` tags and will display them as properly formatted lists.
  HTML tags like `<ul>` and `<ol>` are rendered as plain text, making them hard to read.

- **Documentation Tool Support**:
  Documentation generation tools like DocFX and Sandcastle are designed to process `<list>` tags.
  They do not recognize HTML tags, so the formatting will be lost or broken in generated documentation.

- **Structured Format**:
  The `<list>` tag supports different types (bullet, number, table) and has a well-defined structure.
  This provides more control over how the content is presented.

- **Compiler Validation**:
  The compiler can validate `<list>` tags and warn about malformed XML documentation.
  HTML tags are not validated, so errors can go unnoticed.

- **Consistent with .NET Standards**:
  The entire .NET ecosystem uses `<list>` for enumerated content in XML documentation.
  Following this convention ensures compatibility and consistency.

- **Better Accessibility**:
  Documentation tools can apply appropriate styling and structure to `<list>` tags.
  This makes documentation more accessible to all developers, including those using assistive technologies.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `<ul>` and `<ol>` HTML tags with the `<list>` XML documentation tag.
Use appropriate type attributes (bullet, number, or table) as needed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2244
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2244
```
