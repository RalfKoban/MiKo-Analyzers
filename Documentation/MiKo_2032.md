# MiKo_2032: Use specific phrase for Boolean return value documentation

## Cause

A Boolean return value documentation does not use the specific format that describes the true case followed by the false case.

## Rule description

For Boolean return values, documentation should explicitly describe the `true` case followed by the `false` case.
Use the format `<see langword="true"/> if ...; otherwise, <see langword="false"/>.`.
This aligns with best practices, ensures clarity and helps developers understand the possible outcomes of the method.

### Rationale behind

Boolean return values represent binary outcomes, and their documentation needs to clearly explain both possible cases.
Using a consistent format for documenting Boolean return values eliminates ambiguity and makes the documentation immediately understandable.

Following a standard format for Boolean return value documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  Explicitly documenting both true and false cases removes any uncertainty about what each return value means.
  Developers do not need to infer the false case when only the true case is documented.

- **Consistent Reading Pattern**:
  Using the same format across the codebase creates a predictable pattern.
  Developers can quickly scan Boolean return value documentation and understand the method behavior.

- **Improved Decision Making**:
  Clear documentation of both cases helps developers make better decisions when calling the method.
  They can see exactly what conditions lead to each return value.

- **Better Code Comprehension**:
  When both cases are documented, developers can understand the full behavior of the method without having to read the implementation.
  This improves code comprehension and reduces the need to dig into method details.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Explicit documentation of both cases reduces the likelihood of logic errors when consuming the method.
  Developers are less likely to make incorrect assumptions about the return value.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Following the .NET Framework conventions for Boolean documentation makes the codebase feel more professional and well-maintained.
  This consistency aligns with standard .NET practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, document the Boolean return value using the format `<see langword="true"/> if ...; otherwise, <see langword="false"/>.`.
Clearly describe the condition that leads to the true case, and the false case will be understood as the opposite condition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2032
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2032
```
