# MiKo_1037: Do not suffix types with `Type`, `Interface`, `Class`, `Struct`, `Record` or `Enum`

## Cause

A type name ends with `Type`, `Enum`, `Class`, `Struct`, `Record`, or `Interface`.

## Rule description

Avoid using suffixes such as `Type`, `Enum`, `Class`, `Struct`, `Record`, or `Interface` in type names.
These suffixes do not add value and only make names longer.
Prefer concise, meaningful names that clearly indicate the type's purpose.

The type's declaration already makes it clear whether it is a class, struct, enum, etc.
Adding this information to the name is redundant.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing type names with their kind (such as `Class`, `Enum`, `Struct`, `Record`, or `Interface`) is redundant because the type declaration itself already provides this information.
These suffixes add unnecessary length to names without improving understanding of what the type represents or does.

Good type names should describe the purpose and meaning of the type in the domain, not repeat technical information that is already explicit in the code.
When type names focus on what they represent rather than how they are implemented, the code becomes more readable and maintainable.

Removing these technical suffixes provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter names are easier to scan and understand.
  `Color` is clearer than `ColorEnum` and `Point` is clearer than `PointStruct`.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The type declaration already shows whether it is a class, struct, enum, record, or interface.
  Repeating this in the name adds no value.

- **Better Domain Focus**:
  Type names should describe what they represent in the domain, not technical implementation details.
  `PaymentStatus` is more meaningful than `PaymentStatusEnum`.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  If a type is refactored from one kind to another (for example, from class to struct or record), the name does not need to change.
  This avoids cascading updates throughout the codebase.

- **Consistency with Framework Design**:
  The .NET Framework and modern libraries do not use these suffixes.
  Types like `String`, `DateTime`, and `FileMode` demonstrate clean naming without technical markers.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Clean, concise names signal well-designed code.
  Avoiding redundant suffixes makes the codebase feel more polished and thoughtfully architected.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Type names should communicate purpose, not structure.
  `ValidationResult` conveys meaning, while `ValidationResultClass` adds noise without clarifying anything.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to remove the redundant suffix, using a name that describes what the type represents rather than its technical classification.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1037
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1037
