# MiKo_2038: Start command `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A command type `<summary>` documentation does not start with the default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation for a command should start with a standard phrase such as `Represents a command that can...`.
This clearly describes the command's functionality and ensures consistency and clarity for developers.

### Rationale behind

Command types encapsulate actions that can be executed, and their documentation needs to clearly explain what action the command represents.
Using a consistent starting phrase for command type documentation helps developers quickly identify and understand the purpose of the command.

Following a standard format for command type documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Command Identity**:
  Starting command documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear that the type is a command.
  Developers can quickly identify command types and understand their role in the application.

- **Consistent Pattern Recognition**:
  Using the same phrase across the codebase creates a predictable pattern for command documentation.
  This consistency helps developers navigate and understand the application's command structure.

- **Better Architecture Understanding**:
  Clear command documentation helps developers understand the application's architecture and how commands fit into the overall design.
  This is especially important in MVVM and similar architectural patterns.

- **Improved Code Navigation**:
  When command types are consistently documented, developers can more easily search for and locate specific commands.
  This improves code navigation and reduces time spent searching for functionality.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Following a standard convention for command documentation makes the codebase feel more professional and well-organized.
  This consistency demonstrates attention to detail and good development practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the command type documentation with the phrase `Represents a command that can...` followed by a description of what action the command performs.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the command's functionality.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2038
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2038
```
