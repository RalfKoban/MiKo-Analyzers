# MiKo_3224: Simplify value comparisons

## Cause

A logical OR condition combines an equality check with an explicit null-safe `Equals` call for value types, creating a redundant pattern.

## Rule description

Simplify equality comparisons on value types by using specific .NET framework methods.
This approach makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Value equality comparisons can be written in various ways, but some patterns are more concise and clearer than others.
For value types, the simple equality operator is the most appropriate choice.

Simplifying value comparisons provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Using the simple `==` operator makes the code's intent immediately clear.
  Developers can quickly understand that a value equality comparison is being performed.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Removing unnecessary null checks and method calls reduces cognitive load.
  The code's logic becomes more straightforward.

- **Better Performance**:
  Direct value comparisons using `==` are more efficient than method calls.
  The compiler can inline and optimize simple comparisons effectively.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Concise comparison code is easier to modify when requirements change.
  There are fewer parts that can be accidentally broken during updates.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The simple equality operator communicates the comparison's purpose directly.
  The code reads more naturally for value type comparisons.

- **Consistency**:
  Using the standard `==` operator for value types follows common .NET conventions.
  This makes the code more predictable for other developers.

- **Correctness**:
  For value types, the `==` operator is sufficient and doesn't require null handling.
  The redundant null checks are misleading since value types cannot be null (unless explicitly nullable).

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the redundant null-check pattern with the simple equality operator (`==`).

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3224
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3224
```
