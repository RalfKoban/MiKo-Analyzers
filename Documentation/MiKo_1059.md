# MiKo_1059: Do not name types `Impl` or `Implementation`

## Cause

A type name ends with `Impl`, `Implementation`, or `Imp`.

## Rule description

Using `Impl` or `Implementation` in type names is unnecessary and unhelpful.
It is better to name types directly after the interface they implement, without adding an `Impl` marker.
This keeps names clear and concise.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing class names with `Impl`, `Implementation`, or `Imp` adds no meaningful information.
These suffixes merely state the obvious fact that a class implements an interface, which is already visible from the class declaration.

Such naming creates verbose, redundant code that is harder to read and maintain.
The suffix provides no insight into what the class actually does or how it differs from the interface.

Removing `Impl` suffixes from type names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter, more direct names are easier to read and understand.
  Removing unnecessary suffixes reduces visual clutter in the code.

- **Better Code Clarity**:
  When a class is named after what it does rather than the fact that it implements something, the code becomes more self-documenting.
  Names like `UserService` are clearer than `UserServiceImpl`.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Without `Impl` suffixes, class names are shorter and easier to work with.
  This makes refactoring and code navigation faster and less error-prone.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The class declaration already shows which interfaces are implemented.
  Adding `Impl` to the name duplicates this information unnecessarily.

- **Clearer Design Intent**:
  When only one implementation of an interface exists, naming the class the same as the interface (without the `I` prefix) communicates that this is the standard implementation.
  When multiple implementations exist, more descriptive names that explain the differences are better than generic `Impl` suffixes.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework rarely uses `Impl` suffixes in its own classes.
  Following the same approach makes code feel more professional and consistent with framework conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Impl` or `Implementation` suffix from the type name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1059
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1059
