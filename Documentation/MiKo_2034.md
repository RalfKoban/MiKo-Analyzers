# MiKo_2034: Start Enum return value documentation with default phrase

## Cause

An Enum return value documentation does not start with a default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation of an Enum as return value should have a specific phrase that clearly describes what the returned enumeration value represents.

### Rationale behind

Enum return values represent a specific choice from a set of named constants.
Using a consistent starting phrase helps developers quickly understand what the enumeration represents and what values might be returned.

Following a standard format for Enum return value documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Enum Purpose**:
  Starting Enum documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear what the enumeration represents.
  Developers can quickly understand the meaning of the returned value.

- **Consistent Documentation Pattern**:
  Using a standard phrase for Enum return values creates uniformity across the codebase.
  This consistency helps developers quickly locate and understand methods that return enumerations.

- **Better Understanding of Options**:
  Documenting what the enum represents helps developers understand the possible values and their meanings.
  This is crucial for properly interpreting and handling enum values.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Clear documentation of Enum return values reduces confusion about what the method returns.
  Developers can see exactly what the enumeration represents without having to look up the enum definition.

- **Improved Decision Making**:
  When the enum documentation is clear, developers can make better decisions about how to handle different enumeration values.
  This improves the overall quality of the code that consumes the method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the Enum return value documentation with a specific phrase that describes what the enumeration represents.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the meaning and possible values of the returned enum.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2034
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2034
```
