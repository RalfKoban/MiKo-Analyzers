# MiKo_1009: Name `System.EventHandler` variables properly

## Cause

A variable of an `EventHandler` type is not named `handler`.

## Rule description

`EventHandler` variables should be named `handler` to show they handle events.

This naming convention makes it immediately clear that a variable holds an event handler.
Using a consistent name improves code readability and helps developers quickly identify event handler variables.

When storing an event handler in a variable (for example, to add or remove it from an event), naming it `handler` follows the standard pattern and keeps the code predictable.

### Rationale behind

Naming `EventHandler` variables `handler` creates a clear, consistent convention that makes event-related code more understandable.
When event handlers are stored in variables (typically for later subscription, unsubscription, or reference comparison), using a standard name like `handler` immediately communicates the variable's purpose.

This is particularly important in scenarios where a handler reference needs to be stored to later remove it from an event subscription.
The name `handler` is descriptive enough to convey meaning without being verbose.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Variable Purpose**:
  The name `handler` immediately communicates that the variable contains a delegate that handles an event.
  This clarity distinguishes it from other variables in the same scope.

- **Essential for Unsubscription**:
  When storing a handler reference for later removal from an event, `handler` makes the intent immediately clear.
  This is crucial because event unsubscription requires keeping the exact same delegate reference.

- **Improved Code Scannability**:
  Instead of inventing different names (like `callback`, `listener`, 'subscriber`), the consistent use of `handler` creates a recognizable pattern.
  This uniformity makes code reviews easier and faster.

- **Reduced Naming Fatigue**:
  Having a standard name eliminates the need to come up with creative variations for event handler variables.
  This reduces cognitive load and speeds up development.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  When developers see a variable named `handler`, they immediately understand it is used for event management.
  This helps them quickly grasp the event handling logic without detailed analysis.

- **Simplified Dynamic Event Management**:
  In scenarios where event handlers need to be managed dynamically (added, removed, or replaced), the consistent naming makes the code logic clearer.
  This is especially valuable when working with multiple event subscriptions.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When revisiting code or during code reviews, the standard `handler` name makes event management code immediately recognizable.
  This helps developers understand event lifecycle management without getting distracted by varying naming choices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `EventHandler` variable to `handler`.
