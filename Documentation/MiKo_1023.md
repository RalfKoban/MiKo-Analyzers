# MiKo_1023: Limit field name length

## Cause

A field name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long field names make the code harder to read and can indicate that the field represents a concept that is too complex or poorly abstracted.

### Rationale behind

Limiting field name length is essential for maintaining clean, readable code.
Overly long field names create visual clutter and make code harder to scan, especially when fields are accessed frequently throughout a class.
Long field names can push code off the screen, force awkward line breaks, and make the overall structure of the class difficult to understand at a glance.

Excessively long field names often signal poor abstraction or an attempt to encode too much information in the identifier.
Well-designed classes typically use concise field names that clearly indicate what the field stores without requiring extensive qualifiers.

Keeping field names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter field names are easier to read and make code more scannable.
  Developers can quickly understand what data is stored in a class without processing excessively long identifiers.

- **Better Code Flow**:
  Concise field names make class members easier to identify and work with.
  When fields are referenced throughout a class, shorter names keep the code compact and easier to follow.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Fields with appropriately short names are easier to work with when refactoring or updating code.
  Changes are more straightforward when field names are not excessively long.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When field names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what data a class maintains.
  This makes it easier to understand the state and behavior of objects.

- **Clearer Class Structure**:
  Concise field names help make the overall structure of a class more apparent.
  When field declarations are compact, the class design is easier to understand at a glance.

- **Better Design Indication**:
  Concise field names usually indicate well-designed classes with clear responsibilities.
  When field names are short and focused, it often means the class has a well-defined purpose.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the field name while preserving its essential meaning, using more concise terminology that accurately represents what the field stores.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1023
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1023
```
