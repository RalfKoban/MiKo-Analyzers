# MiKo_6050: Position multi-line arguments outdented at end of method call

## Cause

Multi-line arguments are not positioned outdented at the end of method calls.

## Rule description

Outdent multi-line arguments below the corresponding method call to easily spot them.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

When methods are called with complex arguments that span multiple lines, it can be difficult to distinguish where the argument begins and ends, especially when nested within other method calls.
Outdenting helps create visual boundaries that make the code structure clearer.

Positioning multi-line arguments outdented provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Clarity**:
  Outdenting multi-line arguments creates a clear visual separation between the method call and its arguments.
  Developers can immediately see that the argument is complex and requires multiple lines.

- **Better Code Structure**:
  The outdentation creates a visual hierarchy that shows the relationship between method calls and their arguments.
  This makes it easier to understand nested method calls and complex expressions.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  When arguments are outdented, it is easier to identify where they begin and end.
  Developers can quickly locate the boundaries of complex arguments without having to carefully parse indentation levels.

- **Clearer Argument Boundaries**:
  Outdentation makes it obvious which lines belong to which argument.
  This is especially helpful when multiple arguments are passed to a method, some of which span multiple lines.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  The visual structure created by outdentation reduces the mental effort needed to parse complex method calls.
  Developers can understand the code structure at a glance without having to trace indentation carefully.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When arguments are clearly separated through outdentation, it is easier to modify them without accidentally affecting other parts of the method call.
  Developers can make changes with confidence.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, position multi-line arguments with outdentation below the method call.
Ensure that the argument stands out visually and its boundaries are clear.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6050
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6050
```
