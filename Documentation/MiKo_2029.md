# MiKo_2029: Do not use self-referencing `cref` in `<inheritdoc>` documentation

## Cause

The `<inheritdoc>` tag contains a `cref` attribute that references the same member being documented.

## Rule description

Instead of using `<inheritdoc>` with a `cref` to itself, provide a clear and well-written `<summary>` XML documentation.

### Rationale behind

The `<inheritdoc>` tag is designed to inherit documentation from other members, such as base classes, interfaces, or overridden methods.
Using it with a self-reference creates a circular dependency that provides no useful documentation.

Avoiding self-referencing inheritdoc provides several important benefits:

- **Meaningful Documentation**:
  Self-referencing inheritdoc provides no actual documentation content.
  Writing a proper summary provides useful information to developers instead of creating a documentation loop.

- **Tool Compatibility**:
  Documentation generation tools may not handle self-referencing inheritdoc correctly.
  This can lead to missing or broken documentation in generated API references.

- **Clear Intent**:
  The `<inheritdoc>` tag should indicate that a member follows a contract defined elsewhere.
  Self-reference does not communicate any meaningful intent about the member's purpose.

- **IntelliSense Functionality**:
  Self-referencing inheritdoc may cause IntelliSense to display nothing or show error messages.
  Proper summary documentation ensures developers see helpful information in tooltips.

- **Maintenance Issues**:
  Self-referencing documentation does not help future maintainers understand the code.
  Clear documentation explains what the member does and why it exists.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Proper documentation demonstrates attention to quality and user experience.
  Self-referencing inheritdoc suggests a lack of care or understanding of documentation best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the self-referencing `<inheritdoc>` tag.

Write a proper `<summary>` that clearly describes what the member does, following the documentation guidelines for the member type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2029
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2029
```
