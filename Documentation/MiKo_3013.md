# MiKo_3013: Throw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` (not `ArgumentException`) in `switch` default clauses

## Cause

A `switch` statement's `default` clause throws an `ArgumentException` instead of an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.

## Rule description

In `switch` statements, the `default` clause should throw an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` (or subtype) instead of an `ArgumentException`.
This indicates that the argument provided is outside the expected range, ensuring error handling is clear and accurate.
Keeps the code precise and informative for developers.

### Rationale behind

When a switch statement reaches the default clause for an enum or similar value, it means the argument has a value that was not expected.
This is semantically an out-of-range condition rather than a general argument error.

Using `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in switch default clauses provides several important benefits:

- **More Accurate Error Classification**:
  `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` specifically indicates that a value is outside the expected set of values.
  This is more precise than the generic `ArgumentException`.

- **Better Semantic Meaning**:
  The exception type communicates the exact nature of the problem.
  Developers immediately understand that an unexpected value was provided.

- **Consistent Exception Handling**:
  Code that handles range validation can catch `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` consistently.
  This makes error handling more predictable and organized.

- **Improved Debugging**:
  When examining exception logs, the specific exception type provides immediate insight into the problem.
  `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` clearly indicates a validation issue.

- **Clearer API Contracts**:
  Using the correct exception type documents the expected range of values.
  This helps API consumers understand the constraints without reading documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `ArgumentException` with an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in the switch default clause.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3013
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3013
```
