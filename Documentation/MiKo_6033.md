# MiKo_6033: Place braces of blocks below case sections directly below the corresponding case keyword

## Cause

Braces of blocks below case sections are not placed directly below the corresponding `case` keyword.

## Rule description

Case sections in a switch statement are like conditions in `if` statements.
When a condition matches, the corresponding block gets executed.
Therefore, place the open brace of the block directly below the `case` keyword, just like `if` blocks.

### Rationale behind

Placing braces below case keywords is important for maintaining consistent formatting and visual clarity in switch statements.
This positioning creates a visual parallel with `if` statements, making switch cases easier to understand and helping developers quickly grasp the branching logic.

Placing braces of blocks below case sections directly below the corresponding case keyword provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Conditional Formatting**:
  Aligning case braces with `if` statement braces creates consistency across different conditional structures.
  This uniform formatting makes the code more predictable and easier to read.

- **Clear Case Block Visibility**:
  Braces positioned below the case keyword make each case block immediately recognizable.
  Developers can quickly identify where each case begins and what code it executes.

- **Improved Visual Structure**:
  The formatting creates a clear visual hierarchy that shows the relationship between case labels and their code blocks.
  This makes switch statements easier to scan and understand.

- **Better Readability**:
  When braces are consistently positioned, switch statements are easier to read.
  The visual structure guides the eye through the different cases naturally.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Consistent brace placement makes it simpler to navigate through switch statements.
  Developers can quickly locate specific cases and their associated code blocks.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Clear brace positioning makes it easier to add, modify, or remove cases.
  The consistent structure reduces the risk of formatting errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the open brace of the block directly below the `case` keyword.
Align the brace vertically with the start of the case label.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6033
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6033
```
