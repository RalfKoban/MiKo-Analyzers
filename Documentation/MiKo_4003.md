# MiKo_4003: Place Dispose methods directly after constructors and finalizers

## Cause

Dispose methods are not placed directly after constructors and finalizers.

## Rule description

Constructors, finalizers, and Dispose methods are all tied to an object's lifetime.
They should be placed side by side to keep related code together.
This organization ensures clarity and makes the code easier to find, understand and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Constructors, finalizers, and Dispose methods together define the complete lifecycle of an object: creation, finalization, and cleanup.

Keeping these lifecycle methods together creates a clear narrative of how resources are acquired and released, which is essential for understanding proper resource management in the type.

Placing Dispose methods directly after constructors and finalizers provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Lifecycle Understanding**:
  When all lifecycle methods are grouped together, developers can immediately see the complete picture of how an object is created and cleaned up.
  This makes it easier to understand resource management patterns.

- **Easier Resource Management Verification**:
  Having construction and disposal logic side-by-side makes it simple to verify that all resources acquired in constructors are properly released in Dispose methods.
  This helps prevent resource leaks.

- **Better Pattern Recognition**:
  The proximity of these methods makes it obvious when a type implements the Dispose pattern correctly.
  Reviewers can quickly check that disposal logic matches the acquisition logic in constructors.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  When adding new resources to a type, having all lifecycle methods together makes it easier to update both acquisition and disposal code consistently.
  The relationship between setup and teardown is immediately visible.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to search through the entire class to understand how objects are cleaned up.
  All lifecycle-related code is in one predictable location.

- **Consistent Code Organization**:
  Following a standard pattern for placing lifecycle methods makes all classes in the codebase easier to navigate.
  Developers know exactly where to look for disposal logic.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the Dispose methods so they appear directly after any constructors and finalizers in the class.

Keep all lifecycle-related methods grouped together in the order: constructors, finalizers, then Dispose methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4003
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4003
```
