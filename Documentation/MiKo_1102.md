# MiKo_1102: Do not include `Test` in test method names

## Cause

A test method includes `Test` in its name.

## Rule description

Methods marked as unit tests should not need `Test` in their name.
It's redundant, as the unit test framework already indicates they are tests.
Keep the names clear and descriptive without `Test`.

### Rationale behind

Removing `Test` from test method names is important for clarity and conciseness.

Avoiding `Test` in test method names provides several important benefits:

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The test framework already marks these methods as tests through attributes like `[Test]`, `[Fact]`, or `[TestMethod]`.
  Adding `Test` to the name duplicates this information unnecessarily.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Test names without `Test` are shorter and easier to scan, allowing developers to focus on what the test actually validates rather than the fact that it is a test.

- **Clearer Focus on Behavior**:
  Removing `Test` from names encourages developers to focus on describing the behavior being tested rather than stating the obvious.
  `Saves_user_successfully` is more informative than `TestSavingUser`.

- **Better Test Reports**:
  Shorter test names without redundant markers fit better in test runner output and continuous integration reports, making it easier to identify which behaviors are failing at a glance.

- **Alignment with Modern Practices**:
  Most modern .NET test suites avoid `Test` in method names, so following this convention makes codebases consistent with current community standards.

- **More Natural Naming**:
  Test names that describe behavior directly (like `Returns_null_for_invalid_input`) read more naturally than those prefixed or suffixed with `Test`.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove `Test` from the test method name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1102
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1102
```
