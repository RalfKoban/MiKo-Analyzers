# MiKo_6017: Surround switch statements with blank lines

## Cause

`switch` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `switch` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `switch` statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code structure and improving readability.
Switch statements represent multi-way branching logic that can be complex, and visually separating them helps developers understand where decision-making occurs and how the different cases relate to the surrounding code.

Surrounding switch statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Branching Logic Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `switch` statements stand out as multi-way decision points.
  Developers can immediately identify where complex branching logic occurs in the code.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When switch statements are visually separated, the code logic is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal a transition to multi-way branching rather than simple sequential execution.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into logical sections.
  The complex branching logic of switch statements is clearly distinguished from surrounding code.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Visually distinct switch statements are easier to locate when navigating through code.
  Developers can quickly find branching logic without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated switch statements are easier to work with during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify the entire switch block and trace which case is executed.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When switch statements are clearly separated, modifying branching logic is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where the switch begins and ends, including all its cases.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `switch` statements.
Ensure each switch block is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6017
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6017
```
