# MiKo_6063: Place invocations on same line

## Cause

Invocations span multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when invocations span a single line.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Keeping invocations on a single line is important for maintaining concise and readable code.
When method invocations are unnecessarily spread across multiple lines, they become harder to read and understand, increasing the cognitive effort required to comprehend what the code is doing.

Placing invocations on the same line provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Single-line invocations are easier to read in one glance.
  Developers can immediately see the method being called, its arguments, and its context without having to piece together information from multiple lines.

- **Better Code Flow**:
  When invocations are on single lines, the natural flow of reading code is maintained.
  The eye can move smoothly from one statement to the next without interruption.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Single-line invocations require less mental effort to understand.
  Developers do not need to track multiple lines to comprehend a single method call.

- **Enhanced Scanability**:
  Code with single-line invocations is much easier to scan through quickly.
  Developers can rapidly identify method calls and understand the sequence of operations.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  When an invocation fits on one line, the intent of the code is immediately clear.
  The compact format makes the purpose of the call obvious.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Single-line invocations are easier to modify, move, or remove.
  Changes are less likely to introduce formatting issues or accidental errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the entire invocation on a single line.
Combine all parts of the method call, including the method name and arguments, onto one line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6063
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6063
```
