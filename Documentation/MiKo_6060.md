# MiKo_6060: Place switch case labels on same line

## Cause

Switch case labels span multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when switch case labels span a single line.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Keeping switch case labels on a single line is important for maintaining clean and scannable code.
When case labels are split across multiple lines, they become harder to identify quickly, disrupting the flow of reading through the switch statement and making the code structure less obvious.

Placing switch case labels on the same line provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Scanability**:
  Single-line case labels allow developers to quickly scan through all the cases in a switch statement.
  The eye can move smoothly down the list of cases without having to track multi-line labels.

- **Better Code Structure Visibility**:
  When case labels are on single lines, the overall structure of the switch statement becomes immediately apparent.
  Developers can see at a glance how many cases exist and what values are being handled.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Single-line case labels reduce vertical space consumption and visual clutter.
  This makes the entire switch statement more compact and easier to comprehend as a whole.

- **Easier Pattern Recognition**:
  Consistent single-line formatting creates a visual pattern that helps developers recognize switch statements quickly.
  This pattern recognition speeds up code comprehension.

- **Simplified Code Navigation**:
  When looking for a specific case, single-line labels make it much easier to locate the desired branch.
  Developers can scroll through the cases quickly without losing track of where each case begins.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Adding or removing cases is simpler when each case label is on a single line.
  The consistent format reduces the chance of formatting errors during modifications.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the entire switch case label on a single line.
Combine any elements that are split across multiple lines into one line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6060
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6060
```
