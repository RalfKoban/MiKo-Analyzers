# MiKo_1403: Do not name namespaces after any of their parent namespaces

## Cause

A namespace segment repeats a name from its parent namespaces.

## Rule description

Each namespace segment should provide unique organizational information.
Repeating a parent namespace name is redundant and does not add value.

### Rationale behind

Redundant namespace segments create unnecessary verbosity without adding semantic value.
When a namespace repeats a parent segment, it suggests poor organizational structure and makes the fully qualified names longer without improving clarity.

Eliminating redundant namespace segments provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Non-redundant namespaces are shorter and easier to type, read, and remember.
  This reduces developer effort when writing and reading code.

- **Better Clarity**:
  Each namespace level serves a distinct organizational purpose.
  This makes the hierarchy more meaningful and easier to understand.

- **Cleaner Architecture**:
  Removing redundancy encourages developers to think more carefully about the logical hierarchy of code organization.
  This leads to a more well-thought-out structure.

- **Enhanced Professionalism**:
  Clean, non-redundant namespaces reflect a well-designed codebase.
  This improves the overall impression of code quality and attention to detail.

- **Easier Navigation**:
  Shorter, more meaningful namespace paths make it easier to navigate the codebase.
  Developers can quickly understand where they are in the hierarchy.

- **Reduced Typing Effort**:
  Shorter namespaces mean less typing when using fully qualified names or writing using directives.
  This improves developer productivity.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the namespace to avoid repetition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1403
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1403
```
