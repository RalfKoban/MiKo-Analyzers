# MiKo_3101: Include tests in test classes

## Cause

A unit test class does not contain any unit tests.

## Rule description

A unit test class should contain unit tests.
This ensures the class fulfills its purpose and maintains clarity in your codebase.

### Rationale behind

Test classes exist specifically to verify the behavior of production code.
When a test class does not contain any tests, it serves no purpose and creates confusion in the codebase.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Dead Code**:
  Empty test classes clutter the codebase without providing any value.
  Removing them keeps the test project clean and maintainable.

- **Maintains Code Clarity**:
  Developers expect test classes to contain tests.
  Empty test classes violate this expectation and can mislead developers about test coverage.

- **Improves Test Organization**:
  Ensuring test classes contain actual tests encourages proper organization of test code.
  Tests are placed where they belong rather than being scattered or forgotten.

- **Supports Accurate Metrics**:
  Empty test classes can skew test coverage metrics and other code analysis results.
  Removing them ensures metrics accurately reflect the actual test suite.

- **Reduces Maintenance Burden**:
  Empty classes still need to be maintained when refactoring or updating the codebase.
  Eliminating them reduces unnecessary maintenance work.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, either add unit tests to the test class or remove the empty test class.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3101
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3101
```
