# MiKo_2012: Describe the responsibility in `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation uses vague phrases like `Used to` that do not clearly describe the member's responsibility.

## Rule description

Write `<summary>` documentation that clearly states a member's purpose from the user's perspective.
Avoid vague phrases like `Used to`.
- For types, begin with verbs such as `Represents`, `Provides`, or `Allows`.
- For properties, use `Gets`, `Sets`, or `Gets or sets` depending on their behavior.

This approach ensures concise, meaningful, and user-focused documentation.

### Rationale behind

Vague phrases like `Used to` create passive, unclear documentation that does not effectively communicate what a member does.
Strong, active verbs immediately tell developers the purpose and capability of the code.

Writing clear, responsibility-focused documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Understanding**:
  Active verbs like `Provides` or `Represents` immediately communicate what the member does.
  Developers can understand the purpose at a glance without reading multiple sentences.

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  Vague phrases like `Used to` can mean many different things.
  Specific verbs eliminate ambiguity and provide precise information about the member's role.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  When developers hover over a member in IntelliSense, they see clear, concise information about what it does.
  This speeds up development and reduces the need to look at implementation details.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework uses specific verbs for different member types.
  Following the same patterns makes custom code feel familiar and professional.

- **Reduced Documentation Size**:
  Clear, active documentation is more concise than wordy explanations using passive phrases.
  This makes documentation easier to read and maintain.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Well-written documentation demonstrates attention to quality and adherence to best practices.
  This makes the codebase more appealing to other developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the documentation using strong, specific verbs that clearly describe what the member does.

- For classes and interfaces, use verbs like `Represents`, `Provides`, `Defines`, or `Allows`.
- For properties, start with `Gets`, `Sets`, or `Gets or sets` based on the property's accessors.
- For methods, use action verbs that describe what the method accomplishes.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2012
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2012
```
