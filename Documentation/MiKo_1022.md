# MiKo_1022: Limit parameter name length

## Cause

A parameter name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long parameter names make method signatures harder to read and can indicate that the parameter represents a concept that is too complex.

### Rationale behind

Limiting parameter name length is important for maintaining readable method signatures and clear code.
Overly long parameter names make method declarations difficult to read, especially when methods have multiple parameters.
They can force awkward line breaks, make method signatures span multiple lines unnecessarily, and obscure the overall structure of the method.

Long parameter names often indicate that the parameter represents a concept that is too complex or poorly abstracted.
Well-designed APIs use parameter names that are descriptive but concise, conveying the parameter's purpose without excessive verbosity.

Keeping parameter names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Signature Readability**:
  Shorter parameter names keep method signatures clean and easy to read.
  Developers can quickly understand what parameters a method expects without processing excessively long identifiers.

- **Better Code Flow**:
  Concise parameter names make the code within method bodies flow more naturally.
  When parameters are referenced throughout a method, shorter names keep the code compact and easier to follow.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Parameters with appropriately short names are easier to work with when modifying method signatures or implementations.
  Changes are more straightforward when parameter names are not excessively long.

- **Improved Productivity**:
  Concise parameter names are faster to type and less prone to typos.
  This improves developer efficiency when implementing or calling methods.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Well-chosen short parameter names often communicate intent more clearly than verbose names.
  They focus on what the parameter represents without unnecessary qualification.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When parameter names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what data is being passed to a method.
  This makes it easier to understand method contracts and use APIs correctly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the parameter name while preserving its essential meaning, using more concise terminology or abbreviations that are well-understood in context.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1022
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1022
```
