# MiKo_2056: End `ObjectDisposedException` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

An `ObjectDisposedException` documentation does not end with the default phrase.

## Rule description

When documenting an `ObjectDisposedException` being thrown, the documentation should end with the specific phrase "... has been disposed." If the class includes a `Close` method, it should end with "... has been closed."
This distinction clearly indicates the reason for the exception and helps developers understand the status of the object.

### Rationale behind

`ObjectDisposedException` is thrown when an operation is attempted on a disposed object.
Using a consistent ending phrase for `ObjectDisposedException` documentation makes it immediately clear that the object has been disposed or closed, which is the root cause of the exception.

Using the default phrase for `ObjectDisposedException` documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Exception Documentation**:
  Using the same ending phrase across the codebase creates uniformity in how `ObjectDisposedException` is documented.
  Developers know exactly what to expect when they see this exception type.

- **Clear Object State**:
  The standard phrase clearly indicates that the object is in a disposed or closed state.
  This helps developers understand why the operation cannot be performed.

- **Aligned with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET Framework uses similar phrasing for `ObjectDisposedException` documentation, and following the same pattern makes the codebase feel more professional and aligned with .NET conventions.

- **Proper Disposal Pattern Understanding**:
  Consistent documentation reinforces the importance of the dispose pattern and helps developers understand object lifecycle.
  This improves overall code quality.

- **Better Error Handling**:
  When developers understand that an exception indicates a disposed object, they can write better error handling and object lifecycle management code.
  This reduces bugs related to object disposal.

- **Close vs Dispose Distinction**:
  The rule distinguishes between `closed` and `disposed` based on whether the class has a Close method, which aligns with .NET conventions for types like streams and readers.
  This distinction improves documentation accuracy.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the `ObjectDisposedException` documentation to end with "... has been disposed." for classes implementing IDisposable, or "... has been closed." for classes that have a Close method.
Ensure the phrase clearly indicates the object's disposed or closed state.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2056
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2056
```
