# MiKo_2200: Start comments with a capitalized letter

## Cause

A comment does not start with a capitalized letter.

## Rule description

Documentation should always start with a capitalized letter to form a complete sentence.
This ensures clarity and professionalism, making the documentation easy to read and understand.
Full sentences convey complete thoughts, which is essential for accurate and effective communication.

### Rationale behind

Documentation that does not start with a capital letter appears unprofessional and can be harder to read.
Capitalization is a basic convention of written language that signals the start of a sentence.

When comments do not follow standard grammar rules, they can appear careless or hastily written.
This reduces trust in the documentation and can make it harder to distinguish between different comments or sections.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Proper capitalization makes documentation look polished and well-maintained.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Capital letters at the start of sentences make it easier to identify where thoughts begin and end.

- **Better Communication**:
  Following standard grammar conventions ensures documentation is clear and easy to understand.

- **Consistent Style**:
  Uniform capitalization creates a predictable documentation pattern across the codebase.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Proper sentence structure helps developers distinguish between separate ideas or statements.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, capitalize the first letter of the comment.
