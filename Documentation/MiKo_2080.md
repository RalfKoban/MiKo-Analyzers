# MiKo_2080: Start field `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation of a field does not start with a standard default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation of fields should start with a default phrase.

### Rationale behind

Fields are storage locations for data within a type, and their documentation should clearly describe what data they hold.
Using a consistent starting phrase for field documentation creates a predictable pattern that makes the codebase easier to navigate.

When fields follow a standard documentation pattern, developers can quickly scan through the members of a type and understand what each field represents.
This consistency is especially important in larger codebases where multiple developers work on the same code.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Documentation Style**:
  Using standard phrases for fields creates a uniform documentation pattern across the codebase.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Predictable documentation structure makes it faster to read and understand multiple field declarations.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  Developers can quickly identify and understand fields when scanning through type members.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Consistent documentation patterns make the codebase appear well-organized and maintained.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Standard patterns are easier to maintain and update than ad-hoc documentation styles.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the field documentation to start with an appropriate standard phrase that describes what the field holds or represents.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2080
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2080
```
