# MiKo_2201: Start sentences in comments with a capitalized letter

## Cause

A sentence within a comment does not start with a capitalized letter.

## Rule description

Sentences within documentation should always begin with a capitalized letter to form a complete sentence.
This ensures clarity, readability, and professionalism, making the documentation easier to understand and more effective.
Full sentences convey clear, complete thoughts, which is essential for precise communication.

### Rationale behind

Each sentence within documentation represents a distinct thought or piece of information.
When sentences do not start with capital letters, it becomes harder to identify where one idea ends and another begins.

Proper capitalization within multi-sentence documentation helps readers parse the information more easily.
Without it, documentation can appear as a run-on text that is difficult to read and understand.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Sentence Boundaries**:
  Capital letters make it immediately obvious where each sentence starts, improving readability.

- **Better Information Processing**:
  Proper sentence structure helps readers mentally separate and process different ideas.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Consistent capitalization throughout documentation demonstrates attention to detail.

- **Improved Comprehension**:
  Well-structured sentences with proper capitalization are easier to understand quickly.

- **Consistent Grammar**:
  Following standard grammar rules creates documentation that meets professional writing standards.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, capitalize the first letter of each sentence within the comment.
