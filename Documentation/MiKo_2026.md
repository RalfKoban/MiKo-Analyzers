# MiKo_2026: Do not document used parameters as unused

## Cause

The documentation for a parameter that is actually used incorrectly states that the parameter is unused.

## Rule description

Documentation must always be accurate.
If a parameter is still in use, it should never be labeled as unused.
Keeping documentation truthful and clear is crucial for effective maintenance and development.

### Rationale behind

Documentation that contradicts the actual code is worse than no documentation at all.
When developers cannot trust the documentation, they must always verify statements by reading the implementation, which defeats the purpose of having documentation.

Ensuring parameter documentation accuracy provides several important benefits:

- **Trust in Documentation**:
  When documentation accurately reflects the code, developers can rely on it to make decisions.
  Inaccurate documentation destroys this trust and makes all documentation suspect.

- **Prevents Incorrect Modifications**:
  If a parameter is falsely documented as unused, a developer might remove it, breaking the functionality.
  Accurate documentation prevents these destructive changes.

- **Clear Parameter Purpose**:
  Parameters should be documented with their actual purpose and usage.
  Marking them as unused provides no value and can mislead developers about the method's behavior.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  Accurate documentation helps developers understand what each parameter does and why it is needed.
  False `unused` markers provide no useful information and waste documentation space.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When documentation matches the code, maintenance becomes simpler and faster.
  Developers can rely on documentation during refactoring without verifying every statement.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Accurate documentation demonstrates attention to quality and professionalism.
  Inaccurate documentation suggests carelessness that may extend to other aspects of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove any statements claiming the parameter is unused.

Document the actual purpose and usage of the parameter instead.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2026
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2026
```
