# MiKo_3221: Use `HashCode.Combine` in GetHashCode overrides

## Cause

A `GetHashCode` override does not use `HashCode.Combine`.

## Rule description

To improve the quality of the hash code returned by `GetHashCode`, use the `HashCode.Combine` method.
This is especially useful when dealing with simple underlying data types like integers and keeps your hash codes robust and efficient.

### Rationale behind

Implementing `GetHashCode` manually is error-prone and often results in poor hash code distribution.
The `HashCode.Combine` method provides a well-tested, efficient implementation that handles common scenarios correctly.

Using `HashCode.Combine` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Correctness**:
  The method uses a proven algorithm that generates high-quality hash codes with good distribution.
  This reduces the likelihood of hash collisions in collections like dictionaries and hash sets.

- **Better Performance**:
  The implementation is optimized for performance and generates hash codes more efficiently than manual implementations.
  This can improve the performance of collections that rely on hash codes.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Manual hash code implementations require careful consideration of overflow, bit shifting, and prime numbers.
  Using `HashCode.Combine` eliminates this complexity.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  The method is easier to understand and modify than custom hash code algorithms.
  Changes to the type's properties can be reflected by simply updating the parameters to `Combine`.

- **Consistency**:
  Using the framework-provided method ensures hash code generation follows .NET best practices.
  This makes the codebase more consistent and predictable.

- **Safety**:
  The method handles null values and edge cases correctly without additional code.
  This reduces the risk of runtime errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace manual hash code calculation with `HashCode.Combine`.
Pass all fields and properties that are used in equality comparison as parameters to the method.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3221
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3221
```
