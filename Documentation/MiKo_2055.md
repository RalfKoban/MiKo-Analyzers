# MiKo_2055: Start `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` documentation does not start with the default phrase.

## Rule description

When documenting an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` being thrown, the documentation should start with the specific phrase: `<paramref name="value"/> is ...`.
This approach ensures clarity and consistency, helping developers understand under what condition the argument is considered out of range.

### Rationale behind

`ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown when an argument value falls outside the acceptable range of values.
Using a consistent starting phrase for `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` documentation makes it immediately clear which parameter is out of range and leads naturally into describing the valid range.

Using the default phrase for `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Exception Documentation**:
  Using the same starting phrase across the codebase creates uniformity in how `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is documented.
  Developers know exactly what to expect when they see this exception type.

- **Clear Parameter Identification**:
  Starting with the parameter reference immediately identifies which argument is out of range.
  This helps developers quickly locate and fix range validation issues.

- **Aligned with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET Framework uses similar phrasing for `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` documentation, and following the same pattern makes the codebase feel more professional and aligned with .NET conventions.

- **Natural Flow to Range Description**:
  Starting with the parameter name leads naturally into describing what range is acceptable.
  This creates a logical documentation flow that is easy to read and understand.

- **Better Validation Understanding**:
  Consistent documentation helps developers understand what values are acceptable for parameters.
  This reduces errors when calling methods with range-validated parameters.

- **Improved API Usability**:
  When range requirements are clearly documented in a consistent format, developers can more easily use the API correctly.
  This improves the overall developer experience.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` documentation to start with the phrase `<paramref name="value"/> is ...` where `value` is replaced with the actual parameter name.
Complete the phrase by describing what condition makes the argument out of range or what the acceptable range is.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2055
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2055
```
