# MiKo_4103: Place One-Time test initialization methods before all other methods

## Cause

One-time test initialization methods are not placed before all other methods.

## Rule description

One-time test initialization methods set up the key parts of the test environment.
To make them easy to find, place these methods first.

### Rationale behind

One-time test initialization methods execute once before all tests in a test class run, establishing the foundational environment that all tests depend on.

Placing these methods first in the class reflects their primary importance and ensures developers immediately see how the test environment is configured.

Placing one-time test initialization methods before all other methods provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Environment Understanding**:
  When one-time setup methods appear first, developers can immediately understand the test environment before reading any tests.
  This provides essential context for understanding what each test is working with.

- **Clear Execution Order**:
  The position reflects when the code executes: one-time setup runs first, so it appears first.
  This makes the test lifecycle intuitive and easy to follow.

- **Better Test Debugging**:
  When investigating test failures, developers often need to check the test environment setup.
  Having one-time initialization at the top makes it the first place to look.

- **Emphasized Importance**:
  Placing these methods first highlights their foundational role in the test class.
  This ensures developers are aware of the shared state and dependencies that all tests rely on.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Changes to the test environment often require updating one-time setup.
  Having it in a predictable location at the top makes it quick to find and modify.

- **Consistent Test Structure**:
  A standard pattern where one-time setup always comes first makes all test classes easier to navigate.
  Developers know exactly where to look across the entire test suite.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the one-time test initialization methods to the beginning of the test class.

They should appear before all other methods, including test cleanup, initialization, and test methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4103
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4103
```
