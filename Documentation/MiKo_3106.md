# MiKo_3106: Do not use equality or comparison operators in assertions

## Cause

A test method uses equality or comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`), the `is` keyword for type checks or boolean comparisons, or the `Equals()` method within an `Assert.That` statement.

## Rule description

Assertions like `Assert.That(...)` with operators (`==`, `!=`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`) assert for booleans.
Patterns like `is true`, type checks via `is`, or `Equals()` method also do the same.

When such a test fails, it is hard to understand why.
The failure message does not help much (e.g., `true` expected but `false` received), requiring careful inspection or even debugging, which is frustrating, especially with unstable tests.

Instead, tests should immediately state the expected value (e.g., `5` was expected but `12` was received) for clarity and easier troubleshooting.

### Rationale behind

Test assertions should provide clear and actionable feedback when they fail.
Using comparison operators in assertions produces boolean results that hide the actual values being compared, making failures difficult to diagnose.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **More Informative Failure Messages**:
  Constraint-based assertions show the actual and expected values when tests fail.
  Instead of seeing "expected true but was false", developers see "expected 5 but was 12", which is immediately actionable.

- **Faster Debugging**:
  Clear failure messages eliminate the need to re-run tests with a debugger to see what values caused the failure.
  Developers can understand and fix issues directly from the test output.

- **Reduced Frustration**:
  Boolean failure messages force developers to investigate why a comparison failed.
  Direct value comparisons make the problem obvious, reducing wasted time and frustration.

- **Better Test Maintenance**:
  When tests clearly show what values are expected, they are easier to update when requirements change.
  Developers can see at a glance what the test is verifying.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Explicit constraints like `Is.EqualTo(5)` or `Is.GreaterThan(10)` communicate exactly what condition is being tested.
  Boolean expressions can obscure the actual test criteria.

- **Improved Collaboration**:
  Team members reviewing failing tests can understand issues without consulting the original test author.
  The failure messages themselves provide sufficient context.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace comparison operators and boolean expressions with appropriate NUnit constraints such as `Is.EqualTo()`, `Is.GreaterThan()`, `Is.LessThan()`, `Is.InstanceOf<T>()`, or `Is.True`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3106
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3106
```
