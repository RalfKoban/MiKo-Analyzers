# MiKo_6030: Place open braces of initializers directly below the corresponding type definition

## Cause

The open brace of an initializer is not placed directly below the type definition.

## Rule description

Place the open brace of an initializer directly below the type definition.
This makes initializations clear, distinguishes them from other blocks like `if` blocks, and improves readability, making the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Placing the open brace of initializers directly below the type definition is important for maintaining consistent formatting and visual clarity.
This positioning creates a clear distinction between different types of code blocks and makes object initialization immediately recognizable, helping developers understand the code structure at a glance.

Placing open braces of initializers directly below the corresponding type definition provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Initialization Recognition**:
  Positioning the brace below the type makes initializations visually distinct from other blocks.
  Developers can immediately recognize object initialization rather than control flow structures.

- **Improved Visual Consistency**:
  Consistent brace placement creates a predictable visual pattern throughout the codebase.
  This uniformity makes the code easier to read and navigate.

- **Better Type Association**:
  The brace placement creates a strong visual connection between the type and its initialization.
  This makes it obvious what type of object is being created and initialized.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  The distinct formatting makes initialization blocks easier to read and comprehend.
  Developers can quickly understand object creation without confusing it with control flow logic.

- **Clearer Code Structure**:
  The formatting helps maintain clear code structure by visually separating different types of blocks.
  Initializations stand out from conditional statements and loops.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Consistent formatting makes it easier to modify initializations.
  The clear structure reduces the risk of formatting errors during code changes.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the open brace of the initializer directly below the type definition.
Align the brace vertically with the start of the type name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6030
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6030
```
