# MiKo_1091: Do not suffix variables with specific types

## Cause

A variable name ends with a specific type name like `Comparer`, `Converter`, `Formatter`, etc.

## Rule description

Instead of adding a type suffix to a variable name (like `xyzComparer`), just name it after its function (like `comparer`).
The type already tells what it is, so adding that information again is redundant.

### Rationale behind

Type-specific suffixes in variable names create unnecessary redundancy that makes code harder to read and maintain.
The variable's type is already visible through the declaration or IDE tooltips, so repeating this information in the name adds no value.

Using clean, concise variable names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter variable names without redundant type information are easier to read and understand.
  Developers can focus on what the variable represents rather than being distracted by type information that is already available.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Following a consistent naming pattern across the codebase makes it easier for developers to understand and predict variable names.
  This reduces cognitive load when reading unfamiliar code.

- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**:
  When type information is not duplicated in names, refactoring becomes easier.
  If the type changes, only the type declaration needs to be updated, not the variable name as well.

- **Cleaner Code**:
  Variables with concise names result in cleaner, more professional-looking code.
  This makes the code more pleasant to work with and easier to review.

- **Focus on Intent**:
  Names that describe what the variable does or represents (rather than its type) communicate the intent more clearly.
  This helps developers understand how to use the variable correctly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the type-specific suffix and use a generic name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1091
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1091
```
