# MiKo_1070: Use plural names for local collection variables

## Cause

A local variable for a collection does not have a plural name.

## Rule description

Local variables for collections (like those implementing `IEnumerable`) should have plural names that describe the contents, not the collection itself.

### Rationale behind

Using plural names for collection variables makes code more readable and natural.
When a variable name uses a plural form, it immediately signals to developers that the variable holds multiple items, not just a single one.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  Plural names make the code read more naturally, like a sentence.
  For example, `foreach (var user in users)` is more intuitive than `foreach (var user in userCollection)`.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The variable name immediately tells what kind of data it contains without needing to check its type or look at its declaration.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to mentally translate between the variable name and what it represents.
  The name directly describes the content.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Following a standard naming pattern across the codebase makes it easier for teams to understand each other's code.

- **Simplified Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can more quickly understand what variables represent, making the review process faster and more effective.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the collection variable to use a plural form.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1070
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1070
```
