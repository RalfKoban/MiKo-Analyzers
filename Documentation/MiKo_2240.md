# MiKo_2240: Do not start `<response>` documentation with `Returns`

## Cause

A `<response>` tag in documentation starts with the word `Returns`.

## Rule description

Documentation for a response value should start with a default phrase that provides a detailed description of what the response is.
This approach helps clarify the purpose and use of the response value for developers.

### Rationale behind

Starting response documentation with `Returns` is redundant because the `<response>` tag already indicates that the documentation describes a return value.
This redundancy wastes space and does not add useful information.

Starting response documentation appropriately provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Redundancy**:
  The `<response>` tag itself makes it clear that the documentation describes what is returned.
  Starting with `Returns` repeats this information unnecessarily.

- **More Descriptive Content**:
  Removing `Returns` allows the documentation to immediately describe what the response value represents.
  This makes the documentation more informative and useful.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  IntelliSense tooltips are more helpful when they immediately provide meaningful information.
  Starting with `Returns` wastes the first word without adding value.

- **Consistent Style**:
  Following a standard pattern where response documentation directly describes the value creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes documentation more predictable.

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Removing unnecessary words makes documentation more concise.
  Developers can quickly read and understand what the response represents.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Well-formatted documentation that avoids redundant phrasing demonstrates attention to detail and understanding of documentation best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the word `Returns` from the start of `<response>` documentation and directly describe what the response value represents.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2240
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2240
```
