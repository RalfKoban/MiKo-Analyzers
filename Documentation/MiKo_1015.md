# MiKo_1015: Use `Initialize` instead of `Init` in method names

## Cause

A method name uses the abbreviation `Init` instead of the full word `Initialize`.

## Rule description

Instead of using the short form `Init`, use the full word `Initialize`.
Using `Init` is considered lazy and less clear.

Abbreviated names can be confusing, especially for developers who are not familiar with common abbreviations.
Using complete words makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand.

The extra characters for `Initialize` are worth the improved clarity and professionalism.

### Rationale behind

Using `Initialize` instead of `Init` is important for maintaining professional, readable code that follows .NET Framework Design Guidelines.
While `Init` might save a few keystrokes, it sacrifices clarity and professionalism for minimal gain.
Modern IDEs provide auto-completion, making the length of identifiers largely irrelevant during coding.

The full word `Initialize` is immediately understandable to all developers, including those whose native language is not English or who are less familiar with common programming abbreviations.
Abbreviations can introduce ambiguity - does `Init` mean initialize, initiate, or initial?
The complete word eliminates this uncertainty.

Using complete words provides several important benefits:

- **Universal Clarity**:
  The full word `Initialize` is unambiguous and immediately understood by all developers.
  Abbreviations like `Init` can be confusing, especially for non-native English speakers.

- **Improved Searchability**:
  Searching for "Initialize" consistently finds relevant methods.
  "Init" might produce false matches or be harder to search for distinctly.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework uses complete words (e.g., InitializeComponent in Windows Forms and WPF).
  Following this pattern integrates custom code with platform standards.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Complete words demonstrate attention to code quality and readability.
  Avoiding abbreviations signals a well-maintained, professional codebase.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  `Initialize` has a single, clear meaning.
  `Init` could mean initialize, initiate, initial, or even initialization.

- **Accessibility for All Developers**:
  Complete words make code more accessible to developers of all experience levels.
  Junior developers and those learning .NET do not need to decode abbreviations.

- **IDE Auto-Completion**:
  Modern development tools make typing full words effortless.
  The slight additional length is not a burden during development.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to use `Initialize` instead of `Init`.
