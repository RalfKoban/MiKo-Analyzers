# MiKo_5015: Do not intern string literals

## Cause

A string literal is being interned using 'string.Intern()`.

## Rule description

Do not intern string literals.
They are already interned, so doing it again does not add any value.

### Rationale behind

The .NET runtime automatically interns all string literals that appear in the code.
This means that identical string literals in the source code share the same memory location.
Calling 'string.Intern()` on a string literal is redundant because the string is already in the intern pool.

The string interning process is designed to optimize memory usage by ensuring that identical strings are stored only once.
However, applying 'string.Intern()` to literals that are already interned wastes CPU cycles and adds unnecessary code.

Avoiding redundant string interning provides important benefits:

- **No Unnecessary Processing**:
  Calling 'string.Intern()` on an already-interned string performs a lookup in the intern pool for no reason.
  This wastes CPU cycles checking if the string is already interned, which it always is for literals.

- **Cleaner Code**:
  Removing redundant 'string.Intern()` calls makes the code simpler and easier to read.
  Developers reading the code do not have to wonder why literals are being interned.

- **Correct Understanding**:
  Using 'string.Intern()` on literals suggests a misunderstanding of how string interning works.
  Removing these calls improves code quality by eliminating this confusion.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Code without unnecessary operations is easier to maintain.
  Future developers do not waste time trying to understand why literals are being explicitly interned.

- **Performance**:
  While the performance impact is small, removing unnecessary method calls is always beneficial.
  In hot paths, even small savings can add up.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the 'string.Intern()` call and use the string literal directly.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5015
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5015
```
