# MiKo_3027: Do not reserve parameters for future use

## Cause

A method has parameters that are documented or named as being reserved for future use.

## Rule description

Marking parameters for future use results in poor design.
It's uncertain if the parameter will ever be used or if its type will fit future needs.
Instead, override methods and add new parameters as needed.
This approach maintains clarity and adaptability in the code, avoiding unnecessary clutter and potential issues.
Keeps the codebase clean and efficient.

### Rationale behind

Parameters reserved for future use violate the YAGNI (You Are not Gonna Need It) principle and create maintenance burdens.
They pollute method signatures with unused elements and make assumptions about future needs that may never materialize.

Avoiding reserved parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Cleaner API Design**:
  Method signatures should reflect current requirements, not speculative future needs.
  Reserved parameters make the API confusing and unnecessarily complex.

- **Better Flexibility**:
  Future requirements are unpredictable.
  Creating method overloads or new methods when needed provides more flexibility than pre-allocated parameters.

- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**:
  Unused parameters must be maintained even though they serve no purpose.
  Every caller must provide values for parameters that are ignored.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Methods should communicate what they currently do, not what they might do someday.
  Reserved parameters obscure the method's actual purpose.

- **Easier Testing**:
  Methods with only necessary parameters are simpler to test.
  Reserved parameters create additional test cases that verify nothing useful.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the reserved parameter.
When future needs arise, create a new method overload or a new method with the additional parameters.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3027
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3027
```
