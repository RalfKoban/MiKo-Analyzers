# MiKo_2205: Use `<note>` for important information in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses terms like `Important` or `Attention` directly instead of the `<note>` tag.

## Rule description

XML documentation should utilize the `<note>` tag for important information.
Avoid using terms like `Important` or `Attention` directly.
This approach allows XML documentation tools to recognize and format the information in a distinct and noticeable way, ensuring clarity and emphasis.

### Rationale behind

Important information needs to stand out visually in documentation so developers do not miss critical details.
When important information is marked with plain text like `Important:`, documentation tools cannot apply special formatting to make it prominent.

The `<note>` tag is specifically designed to highlight important information and enables documentation tools to render it with special styling, such as highlighted boxes, icons, or different colors.
This ensures that critical information catches the developer's attention.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Visual Prominence**:
  Documentation tools can render notes with special formatting that makes them stand out from regular text.

- **Better Attention**:
  Developers are more likely to notice and read important information when it is visually distinct.

- **Consistent Styling**:
  Notes appear with consistent, professional formatting across different documentation viewers.

- **Improved Safety**:
  Important warnings and caveats are less likely to be overlooked when properly formatted.

- **Professional Presentation**:
  Using proper tags for special content demonstrates attention to documentation quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace plain text markers like `Important:` with the `<note>` tag, optionally specifying the type attribute.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2205
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2205
```
