# MiKo_6015: Surround do/while loops with blank lines

## Cause

`do while` loops are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `do while` loops with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `do while` loops with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code structure and improving readability.
Do-while loops represent post-condition iteration where the loop body executes at least once, and visually separating them helps developers understand this unique iteration pattern and how it differs from other loop types.

Surrounding do/while loops with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Iteration Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `do while` loops stand out as post-condition iterative operations.
  Developers can immediately identify where guaranteed-execution iteration occurs in the code.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When loops are visually separated, the code logic is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that the loop body executes before the condition is checked, which is different from `while` loops.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into logical sections.
  The unique structure of do-while loops is clearly distinguished from surrounding code.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Visually distinct loops are easier to locate when navigating through code.
  Developers can quickly find post-condition iteration without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated loops are easier to work with during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify that the loop body will execute at least once before the condition is evaluated.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When `do while` loops are clearly separated, modifying iterative logic is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where the loop begins and where the condition is checked at the end.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `do while` loops.
Ensure each loop is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6015
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6015
```
