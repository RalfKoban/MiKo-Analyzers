# MiKo_3223: Simplify reference comparisons

## Cause

A logical OR condition combines a reference equality check with an explicit null-safe `Equals` call, creating a redundant pattern for reference types.

## Rule description

Simplify equality comparisons on reference types by using specific .NET framework methods.
This approach makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Reference equality comparisons can be written in various ways, but some patterns are clearer than others.
Using the static `object.Equals()` method for reference comparison makes the code's intent explicit and reduces confusion.

Simplifying reference comparisons provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Using `object.Equals()` makes the code's intent immediately clear.
  Developers can quickly understand that a null-safe equality comparison is being performed.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  A single method call is clearer than a complex logical expression.
  This eliminates the need to mentally parse the null-check logic.

- **Better Performance**:
  The static `object.Equals()` method is optimized and avoids redundant checks.
  It eliminates the need to check equality twice (once with `==` and once with `Equals`).

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Explicit equality methods communicate intent clearly.
  Future maintainers will understand the code's purpose without additional documentation.

- **Consistency**:
  Using the standard `object.Equals()` method ensures the codebase follows .NET conventions.
  This makes the code more predictable and easier to work with.

- **Correctness**:
  The static `object.Equals()` method handles null values correctly.
  This reduces the likelihood of bugs from manually implementing null checks.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the redundant null-check pattern with `object.Equals()`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3223
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3223
```
