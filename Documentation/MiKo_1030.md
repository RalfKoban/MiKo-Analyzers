# MiKo_1030: Do not mark base types with `Abstract` or `Base`

## Cause

A type name includes `Abstract` or `Base` to indicate it is a base type.

## Rule description

Using `Abstract` or `Base` in the name of a type to indicate it is a base type is unnecessary.
Any interface or type that is not sealed can serve as a base type, so adding these terms only creates clutter and distracts users.

The type's purpose should be clear from its name without explicitly marking it as abstract or a base class.
The `abstract` keyword and class hierarchy already indicate this relationship.

### Rationale behind

Including `Abstract` or `Base` in type names is redundant because the language already provides clear mechanisms (the `abstract` keyword and inheritance relationships) to convey this information.
These prefixes add noise to type names without providing additional semantic value.

When type names focus on what the type represents in the domain rather than its position in the class hierarchy, the code becomes more maintainable and aligned with business language.

Using `Abstract` or `Base` in type names creates several problems:

- **Coupling Names to Implementation Details**:
  A class might start as abstract but later become concrete, requiring a name change that ripples through the codebase.
  Names should not be tied to implementation details that might change.

- **Reduced Clarity**:
  Prefixes like `Base` or `Abstract` do not help understand what the type does or represents.
  A type named `Vehicle` is more meaningful than `BaseVehicle` or `AbstractVehicle` because it focuses on the domain concept rather than technical structure.

- **Unnecessary Length**:
  Adding these prefixes makes names longer and harder to read without providing value.
  Shorter, clearer names improve code comprehension.

- **Distraction from Purpose**:
  The type's purpose should be evident from its name alone.
  Technical markers distract from understanding the actual role and responsibility of the type.

- **Poor Domain Alignment**:
  Domain-driven design emphasizes using ubiquitous language that matches how the business talks about concepts.
  Business stakeholders speak about `Vehicles`, not `BaseVehicles` or `AbstractVehicles`.

- **Redundant Information**:
  The `abstract` keyword and the presence of derived types in the codebase already make it clear that a type serves as a base class.
  Repeating this information in the name is unnecessary.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to remove `Abstract` or `Base`, using a name that describes what the type represents rather than its position in the class hierarchy.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_1030
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1030
