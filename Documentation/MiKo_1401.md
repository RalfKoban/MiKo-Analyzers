# MiKo_1401: Do not include technical language names in namespaces

## Cause

A namespace name includes technical programming concepts like `Interfaces`, `Exceptions`, `Events`, `Enums`, `Classes`, `Structs`, `Controllers`, `Services`, or other implementation-specific terms.

## Rule description

Namespaces should not include technical programming concepts as they are implementation details.
Focus on the business or functional domain instead.

### Rationale behind

Including technical programming concepts in namespaces creates unnecessary coupling to implementation details that may change over time.
As applications evolve, code organized around technical concepts becomes harder to maintain and understand.
This makes technically-named namespaces misleading and reduces code discoverability.

Avoiding technical concepts in namespaces provides several important benefits:

- **Business-Focused Organization**:
  Namespaces organized by business domain or functional purpose remain stable regardless of implementation approach.
  This prevents the need for extensive reorganization when technical decisions change.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Code organization based on what it does rather than how it is implemented makes the codebase more maintainable.
  Developers can find functionality based on business purpose, not technical implementation.

- **Improved Adaptability**:
  The codebase becomes more adaptable to future architectural changes.
  Switching patterns or adopting new approaches does not require namespace restructuring.

- **Enhanced Code Discoverability**:
  Developers can find code based on functional purpose rather than technical implementation.
  This makes navigation more intuitive and efficient.

- **Domain-Driven Design Alignment**:
  Domain-focused namespaces align better with Domain-Driven Design principles.
  This makes it easier to maintain a clear separation between business logic and technical concerns.

- **Reduced Code Base Cluttering**:
  When types are organized by technical/conceptual namespaces, a single functionality gets scattered across multiple namespaces (such as `Models`, `Interfaces`, `Controllers`, `Exceptions`, `Data`, `Entities`, ...).
  Avoiding those conceptual namespaces keeps the types together that belong together, resulting in much less cluttering of the code base.
  All components of a specific feature or domain remain co-located, making them easier to understand, modify, and maintain as a cohesive unit.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the namespace to focus on business or functional domain rather than technical implementation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1401
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1401
```
