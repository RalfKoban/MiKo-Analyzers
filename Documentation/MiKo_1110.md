# MiKo_1110: Suffix test methods with parameters with underscore

## Cause

A parameterized test method does not end with an underscore.

## Rule description

Parameterized test methods (those with parameters) should end with an underscore to make the parameters stand out and be easier to spot.
The underscore creates visual space before the parenthesis, improving readability.

The extra space created by the underscore before the parenthesis makes it immediately clear that the method accepts parameters and makes the parameter values more visible in test reports.

### Rationale behind

Using an underscore suffix for parameterized test methods is important for test organization and clarity.

Suffixing parameterized test methods with an underscore provides several important benefits:

- **Parameters Stand Out**:
  The trailing underscore creates visual separation before the parenthesis, making the parameter values immediately visible and easier to spot.
  `Do_something_for_value_(42)` is easier to read than `Do_something_for_value(42)` because the underscore provides extra space that draws attention to the parameters.

- **Better Test Failure Reports**:
  When parameterized tests fail, the parameter values are displayed in test reports.
  The underscore makes these values stand out, helping developers quickly identify which specific parameter combination caused the failure.
  This is crucial for easier maintenance and faster debugging.

- **Visual Distinction**:
  The trailing underscore immediately signals that a test method accepts parameters, making it easy to distinguish parameterized tests from regular tests at a glance.
  This helps developers quickly understand the test structure.

- **Improved Readability**:
  The extra visual space created by the underscore reduces cognitive load when scanning test names, especially in test runners where multiple parameter combinations are displayed.

- **Consistent Naming Pattern**:
  This convention creates a predictable pattern across the test suite, reducing cognitive load when reading and writing tests.
  Developers know what to expect when they see an underscore.

- **Better Test Organization**:
  When test methods are sorted alphabetically, parameterized tests with underscores group together with their base name, making related tests easier to find.

- **Clearer Test Reports**:
  In test runners and continuous integration reports, the underscore helps distinguish the test template from individual test case executions, making results easier to interpret.

- **Reduced Naming Conflicts**:
  The underscore allows parameterized and non-parameterized versions of similar tests to coexist without naming collisions, giving flexibility in test design.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  Many testing frameworks and examples use this convention, so following it aligns test code with established community practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add an underscore at the end of the parameterized test method name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1110
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1110
```
