# MiKo_1055: Suffix dependency properties with `Property` (as in the .NET Framework)

## Cause

A field that backs a `DependencyProperty` does not end with the suffix `Property`.

## Rule description

To show that fields are containers for specific dependency properties, add the suffix `Property` to their names.
This aligns with the naming conventions in the .NET Framework.

### Rationale behind

`DependencyProperty` fields serve as registration identifiers for WPF dependency properties.
Without a consistent naming convention, it becomes difficult to distinguish these special fields from regular fields.

The .NET Framework establishes the convention of suffixing `DependencyProperty` fields with `Property`.
Following [this convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/properties/how-to-implement-a-dependency-property) ensures code consistency and makes the codebase easier to understand for developers familiar with WPF.

Using the `Property` suffix for dependency properties provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The `Property` suffix immediately identifies a field as a `DependencyProperty` registration.
  Developers can quickly distinguish between regular fields and dependency property identifiers.

- **Better Framework Consistency**:
  All WPF controls in the .NET Framework follow this naming convention.
  Using the same pattern makes custom controls feel native and professional.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  When using IntelliSense or searching through code, the `Property` suffix makes it easy to find all dependency properties in a class.
  This speeds up development and maintenance work.

- **Clearer Relationship**:
  The suffix makes it obvious which field corresponds to which CLR property wrapper.
  For example, `TextProperty` clearly relates to the `Text` property.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Without the suffix, developers might mistake dependency property fields for regular fields.
  The suffix eliminates this ambiguity and makes the code's intent clear.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `Property` suffix to the `DependencyProperty` field name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1055
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1055
```
