# MiKo_3031: Do not implement ICloneable.Clone()

## Cause

A type implements the `ICloneable` interface.

## Rule description

Avoid implementing `ICloneable.Clone()` because the method does not specify whether it returns a deep or shallow copy, leading to potential inconsistencies.
This ambiguity makes it unreliable, as there is a significant difference between deep and shallow copies.
Ensuring clear, predictable behavior in code is crucial.

### Rationale behind

The `ICloneable` interface has a fundamental design flaw that makes it problematic to use in practice.
The interface does not specify whether the `Clone()` method performs a deep copy or a shallow copy, and this ambiguity can lead to serious bugs.

Avoiding `ICloneable` provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Copy Semantics**:
  Custom copy methods can explicitly indicate whether they perform deep or shallow copies.
  Method names like `DeepCopy()` or `ShallowCopy()` make the behavior obvious to developers using the code.

- **Type Safety**:
  The `ICloneable.Clone()` method returns `object`, requiring a cast to the actual type.
  Custom copy methods can return the specific type, eliminating the need for unsafe casts.

- **Consistent Behavior**:
  When the copy strategy is explicit, developers can rely on predictable behavior.
  Ambiguous interfaces lead to different implementations making different assumptions, causing integration issues.

- **Better Documentation**:
  Custom copy methods can include documentation that explains exactly what is copied and how.
  This helps other developers understand the behavior without needing to read the implementation.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When copy behavior is explicit and well-documented, modifying the copy logic becomes safer.
  Developers can understand the intended behavior and ensure changes preserve it.

- **Reduced Bugs**:
  Ambiguity in copy semantics often leads to subtle bugs where code expects one type of copy but receives another.
  Explicit methods eliminate this entire class of errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the implementation of `ICloneable`.
Instead, create custom copy methods with explicit names that indicate the copy strategy, such as `DeepCopy()` or `ShallowCopy()`.
Ensure these methods return the specific type rather than `object`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3031
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3031
```
