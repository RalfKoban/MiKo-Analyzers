# MiKo_1089: Do not prefix methods with `Get`

## Cause

A method name starts with `Get`.

## Rule description

Methods should not be prefixed with `Get`, especially in repositories or similar data access classes.
Removing the `Get` prefix makes code more readable and natural.
For example, `UsersByCity` reads better than `GetUsersByCity` when used in code.

### Rationale behind

The `Get` prefix is often redundant because methods that return values are already understood to be retrieving or calculating something.
Adding `Get` to every method name adds unnecessary verbosity without improving clarity.
Code reads more naturally when method calls resemble natural language rather than mechanical commands.

Removing the `Get` prefix from methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Code flows more naturally without the `Get` prefix.
  `var users = repository.UsersByCity(city)` reads better than `var users = repository.GetUsersByCity(city)`.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Shorter method names make code more concise and easier to scan.
  The `Get` prefix adds no meaningful information in most cases.

- **Natural Language Flow**:
  Without `Get`, method calls read more like natural language.
  `repository.OrdersForCustomer(id)` is clearer than `repository.GetOrdersForCustomer(id)`.

- **Consistent with Properties**:
  Properties provide values without using `Get` in their names.
  Methods that return values should follow the same convention for consistency.

- **Focus on Intent**:
  The method name should describe what it returns, not the mechanical action of returning.
  `UsersByCity` describes the result, while `GetUsersByCity` focuses on the implementation detail.

- **Cleaner API Design**:
  Modern API design favors concise, descriptive names over verbose prefixes.
  Removing `Get` makes interfaces and repositories feel more polished and professional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Get` prefix from the method name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1089
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1089
```
