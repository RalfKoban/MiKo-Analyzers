# MiKo_3079: Write HResults in hexadecimal

## Cause

An `HResult` value is written as a negative integer instead of hexadecimal notation.

## Rule description

Write `HResult` values in hexadecimal, not as negative integers.
It is much easier to recognize and search for `0x80070005` than `-2147024891`.
Keeps the code clean and user-friendly.

### Rationale behind

`HResult` values are standardized error codes used throughout Windows and .NET APIs.
These values are defined and documented in hexadecimal format, making hexadecimal the natural and expected representation.

Writing `HResult` values in hexadecimal provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Code Readability**:
  Hexadecimal `HResult` values like `0x80070005` are immediately recognizable as error codes.
  Negative decimal numbers like `-2147024891` are not obviously error codes and require conversion to understand.

- **Enables Easy Documentation Lookup**:
  Microsoft documentation, error message databases, and online resources all reference `HResult` values in hexadecimal.
  Using hexadecimal in code allows developers to directly search for and find relevant documentation.

- **Follows Industry Standards**:
  The Windows API and COM interfaces that define `HResult` values use hexadecimal notation.
  Following this standard makes the code consistent with established practices.

- **Reveals Error Code Structure**:
  `HResult` values are bit fields with specific meanings for different bit ranges.
  Hexadecimal notation makes this structure visible, while decimal notation obscures it completely.

- **Simplifies Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers familiar with Windows error codes can immediately recognize common errors in hexadecimal.
  Decimal representations require mental conversion or external tools to understand.

- **Prevents Transcription Errors**:
  When copying error codes from documentation or error messages, hexadecimal values can be copied directly.
  Converting to decimal introduces opportunities for transcription errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, convert the negative decimal `HResult` value to its hexadecimal representation.
Replace the negative integer literal with a hexadecimal literal using the `0x` prefix.
For example, replace `-2147024891` with `0x80070005`.

## How to suppress violations
