# MiKo_1005: Name `System.EventArgs` variables properly

## Cause

A variable of type `System.EventArgs` (or its inheritors) is not named `e`.

## Rule description

To maintain consistency and clarity in code, variables of type `System.EventArgs` (or its inheritors) should be named `e`.

This naming convention follows the standard pattern used in .NET event handlers.
Using a consistent name makes code more predictable and easier to read.

When working with `EventArgs` instances in code, naming them `e` aligns with the convention used in event handler method signatures and makes the code immediately recognizable as event-related.

### Rationale behind

Naming `EventArgs` variables `e` maintains consistency with the ubiquitous event handler parameter naming convention.
This consistency is valuable because it creates a uniform pattern across all event-related code, whether in event handler signatures or in local variables that store or manipulate event arguments.

When developers see a variable named `e`, they immediately recognize it as event data, reducing the mental effort required to understand the code.
This single-letter name is appropriate in the event handling context because the type itself provides all necessary information about what the variable contains.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Pattern Recognition**:
  Using `e` for all `EventArgs` variables creates a uniform pattern throughout the codebase.
  This consistency makes code more predictable and easier to navigate.

- **Immediate Context Understanding**:
  When developers see `e`, they immediately understand it is event data.
  This instant recognition speeds up code comprehension.

- **Appropriate Brevity**:
  The single-letter name keeps code concise while remaining completely clear.
  The type information already describes what the variable contains, so longer names do not add meaningful information.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Using longer, more descriptive names for `EventArgs` variables makes code unnecessarily verbose without improving clarity.
  Brevity improves code scannability.

- **Alignment with Framework Examples**:
  .NET Framework documentation and examples consistently use `e` for `EventArgs`.
  Following this pattern makes code more familiar to all .NET developers.

- **Better Code Scannability**:
  When all event argument variables use the same name, patterns become obvious.
  This makes it easier to spot anomalies or understand event data flow through the code.

- **Simplified Maintenance**:
  The uniform naming convention reduces the cognitive load during maintenance.
  Developers do not need to remember or figure out different names for what is essentially the same kind of variable across different contexts.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `EventArgs` variable to `e`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1005
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1005
