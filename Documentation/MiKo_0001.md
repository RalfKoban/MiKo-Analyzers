# MiKo_0001: Keep methods small

## Cause

A method contains too many lines of code.

## Rule description

Methods should be short to ease reading and maintenance.
When a method becomes too long, it often indicates that it is doing too much and violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Single Level of Abstraction (SLoA).

Long methods are harder to understand, test, and maintain, making the codebase more difficult to work with.

### Rationale behind

Long methods are difficult to understand, test, and maintain.
They make it harder to spot bugs and can become confusing for other developers.
Breaking down long methods into smaller, more focused methods improves readability and makes the codebase easier to work with.

Keeping methods small provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter methods are easier to read and understand at a glance.
  Developers can quickly grasp what the method does without having to read through dozens or hundreds of lines of code.

- **Easier Testing**:
  Small, focused methods are much easier to unit test.
  Each method can be tested independently with fewer test cases needed to cover all possible scenarios.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When a bug needs to be fixed or a feature needs to be changed, it's easier to locate and modify the relevant code in a small method.
  Changes are also less likely to accidentally break something else.

- **Enhanced Reusability**:
  Smaller methods that do one thing well can be used in different parts of the code, which means less duplicate code needs to be written.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Well-named small methods act like self-documenting code.
  The method name tells what it does, and the code inside shows how it works.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When methods are small, developers do not need to remember as much information at once while reading the code.
  This makes it easier to understand what the code is doing and how different pieces fit together.

- **Better Code Design**:
  Small methods usually do just one thing (Single Responsibility Principle), which leads to cleaner, more organized code that's easier to work with.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the method into smaller methods.
Each method should have a single responsibility and operate at a single level of abstraction.

Look for natural boundaries in your code where you can extract functionality into separate methods.
Give these new methods meaningful names that describe what they do.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_0001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_0001
```
