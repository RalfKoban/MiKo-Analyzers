# MiKo_3063: End non-exceptional log messages with a dot

## Cause

A log message that does not include an exception does not end with a period.

## Rule description

End log messages that do not include exceptions with a dot.
This keeps the focus clear and consistent, ensuring that logs are easy to read and understand.
It helps distinguish between general log messages and those that include exception details, maintaining clarity in logging practices.

### Rationale behind

Consistent punctuation in log messages creates professional, readable logs that are easier to analyze.
The distinction between messages with and without exceptions becomes immediately obvious through punctuation.

Ending non-exceptional log messages with a period provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Distinction**:
  Messages ending with periods indicate normal logging, while colons indicate exceptions.
  This visual difference helps developers quickly identify the type of log entry.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Proper punctuation makes logs appear polished and well-maintained.
  This reflects positively on code quality and professionalism.

- **Consistent Format**:
  Establishing punctuation rules creates consistency across the entire codebase.
  Developers know what to expect and can write logs that match the established pattern.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Periods provide visual closure to log statements.
  This makes logs easier to read, especially when scanning through many entries.

- **Easier Analysis**:
  Consistent formatting enables log analysis tools to parse and categorize messages effectively.
  Regular patterns in logs can be processed programmatically.

- **Better Documentation**:
  Well-formatted log messages serve as runtime documentation of application behavior.
  Proper punctuation makes this documentation easier to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure log messages that do not include exceptions end with a period.
Add a period to the end of the message string.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3063
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3063
```
