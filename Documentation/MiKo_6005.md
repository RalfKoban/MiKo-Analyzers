# MiKo_6005: Precede return statements with blank lines

## Cause

`return` statements are not preceded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Precede `return` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from the executing code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Preceding `return` statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear code structure and improving readability.
Return statements represent the exit point of a method or function, and visually separating them helps developers quickly identify where control flow leaves the current context, making the code logic easier to follow.

Preceding return statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Exit Point Visibility**:
  Blank lines make return statements stand out as important control flow points.
  Developers can immediately see where and how the method exits.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When return statements are visually separated, the code logic is easier to follow.
  The blank line signals that the preceding code has completed its work and is now returning a result.

- **Better Code Flow Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the relationship between the logic and the result being returned.
  The blank line indicates a transition from computation to result delivery.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  Visually distinct return statements are easier to locate when debugging.
  Developers can quickly find exit points to verify return values or set breakpoints.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  During code reviews, separated return statements are easier to identify and verify.
  Reviewers can quickly check what values are being returned and under what conditions.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When return statements are clearly separated, modifying the return logic is simpler.
  The visual boundary makes it obvious where the method completes its work.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a blank line before `return` statements.
Ensure each return statement is preceded by a blank line to separate it from the executing code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6005
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6005
```
