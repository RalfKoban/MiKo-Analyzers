# MiKo_3203: Invert if-continue statements when followed by single line

## Cause

An `if` statement contains only a `continue` statement and is followed by a single line of code.

## Rule description

If an `if` statement contains only a `continue` statement and is followed by a single line of code, invert the `if` statement.
This makes the method easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

When an `if` block contains only a `continue` statement followed by a single line, the code can be simplified.
Inverting the condition eliminates the `continue` statement and makes the control flow more explicit.

Inverting `if-continue` statements provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Eliminating `continue` statements makes the code flow more explicit.
  The condition for executing code is clearly stated.

- **Explicit Control Flow**:
  Direct conditional execution is easier to understand than implicit continuation.
  The logic becomes self-documenting.

- **Better Flow**:
  Positive conditions are generally easier to understand than negative ones.
  The code clearly shows when the logic executes.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Fewer control flow statements (`continue`) mean less cognitive load.
  Developers can focus on the actual logic rather than flow control.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Positive conditions communicate the normal execution path.
  The method's behavior is more immediately obvious.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Explicit conditions are easier to modify and extend.
  The transformation makes loop logic more straightforward.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, invert the `if` condition and remove the `continue` statement.
Place the single line of code that follows inside the inverted `if` block.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3203
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3203
```
