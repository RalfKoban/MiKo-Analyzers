# MiKo_6034: Place dots on same line(s) as invoked members

## Cause

Dots in method invocations are placed on different lines than the invoked members.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when dots are placed on the same lines as the invoked members.
This makes the code easier to follow and understand.

### Rationale behind

When dots are placed on different lines than the invoked members, it becomes harder to understand the flow of method calls.
Developers have to visually connect the dot with the member it belongs to, which increases cognitive load and slows down code comprehension.

Keeping dots on the same lines as their invoked members provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The relationship between the dot operator and the member is immediately clear.
  Developers can read method chains naturally from left to right without having to scan multiple lines to understand which member is being invoked.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When dots and members are on the same line, the code structure is easier to parse mentally.
  Developers do not need to remember the context from the previous line while reading the current line.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Placing dots with their members creates a uniform pattern throughout the codebase.
  This consistency makes it easier for developers to navigate and understand different parts of the code.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  When dots and members are together, it is easier to follow method chains and understand the sequence of operations.
  This is especially important when working with fluent APIs or LINQ queries.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The code structure immediately shows what is being called and in what order.
  This makes it easier to understand the purpose of the code without having to mentally reconstruct the method chain.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the dot to the same line as the invoked member.
Ensure that each member invocation and its leading dot are on the same line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6034
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6034
```
