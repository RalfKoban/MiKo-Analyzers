# MiKo_1007: Place events and their `EventArgs` types in the same namespace

## Cause

An event and its associated `EventArgs` type are not in the same namespace.

## Rule description

Events and their event arguments are logically related, so they should be placed in the same namespace for better organization.

Keeping related types together in the same namespace makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand.
When developers work with an event, they can easily find the associated `EventArgs` type in the same namespace.

This organization also makes it clear which `EventArgs` types belong to which events, improving code maintainability.

### Rationale behind

Placing events and their `EventArgs` types in the same namespace follows the principle of cohesion - related types should be grouped together.
When an event and its `EventArgs` are in the same namespace, it creates a clear organizational structure that makes code more discoverable and understandable.

Developers do not need to search across multiple namespaces to find event-related types, which speeds up development and reduces confusion.
This co-location also improves IntelliSense usability.

Following this principle provides several important benefits:

- **Logical Type Grouping**:
  Related types grouped together in the same namespace create a cohesive, organized structure.
  This makes it immediately clear which `EventArgs` types belong to which events.

- **Faster Code Navigation**:
  Developers do not need to search across multiple namespaces to find event-related types.
  Everything needed for working with an event is in one place.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  When a developer types the namespace for an event, the corresponding `EventArgs` type automatically appears in the same completion list.
  This proximity makes it obvious which types are related.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Having related types in the same namespace reduces the mental effort required to understand the event model.
  Developers can focus on functionality rather than searching for related types.

- **Simpler Documentation**:
  Documentation can reference events and their `EventArgs` together when they share a namespace.
  This makes examples and explanations more concise and easier to follow.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  When event-related code needs to be changed or moved, having all related types in one namespace simplifies the process.
  Changes can be made more confidently with less risk of breaking relationships.

- **Better Versioning**:
  When events and their `EventArgs` are co-located, versioning and deprecation become simpler.
  Related types can evolve together without scattered dependencies.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  This organizational pattern is used throughout the .NET Framework.
  Following it makes custom code feel more integrated with platform conventions and easier to maintain.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the event or `EventArgs` type so they reside in the same namespace.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1007
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1007
```
