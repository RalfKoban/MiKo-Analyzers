# MiKo_3215: Use `Func<T, bool>` instead of `Predicate<bool>` for callbacks

## Cause

A method parameter, property, or field uses `Predicate<T>` for a callback.

## Rule description

To standardize delegates and adhere to .NET Framework Design Guidelines, use `Func<T, bool>` for callbacks instead of `Predicate<T>`.
This approach ensures consistency and aligns with best practices.

### Rationale behind

The `Predicate<T>` delegate was created early in .NET's history, but modern .NET prefers the `Func<T, bool>` delegate.
Using `Func<T, bool>` provides consistency with other .NET APIs and simplifies delegate usage.

Using `Func<T, bool>` instead of `Predicate<T>` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  Modern .NET APIs use `Func` delegates rather than specialized predicate types.
  Using `Func<T, bool>` aligns the code with current framework patterns.

- **Better Interoperability**:
  Lambda expressions and method groups work seamlessly with `Func` delegates.
  There is no need to convert between different delegate types.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Having one standard delegate type reduces the number of concepts to remember.
  Developers do not need to know about specialized predicate delegates.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code using standard `Func` delegates is easier to understand and modify.
  The delegate signature is immediately recognizable.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `Func<T, bool>` signature clearly shows input and return types.
  There is no ambiguity about what the delegate does.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  Following .NET Framework Design Guidelines ensures the API feels native.
  This makes the code more familiar to .NET developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `Predicate<T>` with `Func<T, bool>` in method parameters, properties, and fields.
Update any documentation to reflect the new delegate type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3215
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3215
```
