# MiKo_6044: Place operators such as `&&` or `||` on same line(s) as their (right) operands

## Cause

Binary logical operators are placed on different lines than their right-hand operands.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when binary operators like `&&` or `||` are placed on the same lines as their right-hand operands.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Logical operators are essential for constructing complex conditions in code.
When operators are placed on separate lines from their operands, it becomes harder to understand the logical structure and flow of the condition.

Placing operators on the same lines as their right operands provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Each line starts with an operator followed by its operand, creating a clear visual pattern.
  Developers can quickly scan the conditions and understand the logical structure.

- **Clearer Logical Structure**:
  When operators lead their operands, the logical flow is easier to follow.
  Developers can see at a glance which conditions are combined with AND, OR, or other logical operations.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Having operators at the beginning of lines makes it easy to spot the logical operators being used.
  Developers can quickly identify complex conditions and understand how different parts are combined.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Placing operators with their right operands creates a uniform pattern throughout the codebase.
  This consistency makes the code more predictable and easier to work with.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When logical conditions are consistently formatted, it is easier to evaluate them during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify which part of a condition might be causing unexpected behavior.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  The consistent pattern of operator followed by operand reduces the mental effort needed to parse complex conditions.
  Developers can focus on understanding the logic rather than deciphering the formatting.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the binary operator to the same line as its right-hand operand.
Ensure that each line in a multi-line condition starts with the operator (except the first line).

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6044
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6044
```
