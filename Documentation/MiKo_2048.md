# MiKo_2048: Start value converter `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A value converter `<summary>` documentation does not start with a default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation of a value converter should start with a specific phrase that describes what values it converts from and to.

### Rationale behind

Value converters are commonly used in data binding scenarios, particularly in WPF and other XAML-based frameworks, to transform values between the data model and the user interface.
Using a consistent starting phrase for value converter documentation helps developers immediately recognize the type as a converter and understand what transformation it performs.

Following a standard format for value converter documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Converter Purpose**:
  Starting value converter documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear what the converter transforms.
  Developers can quickly understand the input and output types and the transformation logic.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  When value converters are consistently documented, developers can more easily search for and locate converters that perform specific transformations.
  This improves code reuse and reduces duplicate converter implementations.

- **Consistent XAML Documentation**:
  Using a standard phrase for value converters creates uniformity in XAML-based codebases.
  This consistency helps developers navigate and understand the application's data binding infrastructure.

- **Improved Data Binding Understanding**:
  Value converters are key components in data binding, and clear documentation helps developers understand how data flows between the model and view.
  This improves the overall understanding of the application architecture.

- **Reduced Implementation Errors**:
  When converter documentation clearly explains the transformation, developers are less likely to use the wrong converter or implement duplicate functionality.
  This improves code quality and maintainability.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the value converter documentation with a specific phrase that describes what values it converts from and to.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the input type, output type, and the transformation performed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2048
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2048
