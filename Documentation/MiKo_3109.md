# MiKo_3109: Include assertion messages with multiple assertions

## Cause

A test method contains multiple assertions but some or all of them lack descriptive messages.

## Rule description

Assertions should include messages explaining why something was expected but failed.
This makes it easier to understand why a test failed, helping to quickly identify the issue.

### Rationale behind

When a test contains multiple assertions, identifying which assertion failed and why becomes critical for efficient debugging.
Without descriptive messages, developers must analyze the code and potentially re-run tests to understand the failure context.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Faster Failure Diagnosis**:
  Descriptive messages immediately explain which assertion failed and what was being tested.
  Developers can identify the problem without having to read through the entire test method.

- **Better Debugging Experience**:
  When multiple assertions exist in a test, failure messages distinguish between them.
  Without messages, it is unclear which of several similar assertions failed.

- **Reduced Investigation Time**:
  Clear messages eliminate the need to re-run tests with a debugger just to understand the failure context.
  The message itself provides sufficient information to start fixing the issue.

- **Improved Test Maintenance**:
  Messages document the purpose of each assertion, making tests easier to understand and modify later.
  Future developers can grasp the test's intent without deep analysis.

- **Better Collaboration**:
  Team members can understand test failures from build logs or continuous integration reports.
  There is no need to ask the test author what a particular assertion was checking.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Assertion messages act as inline documentation that explains what each verification is checking.
  This makes the test's overall purpose and coverage more transparent.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add descriptive messages to all assertions in test methods that contain multiple assertions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3109
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3109
```
