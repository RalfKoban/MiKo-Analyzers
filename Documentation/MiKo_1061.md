# MiKo_1061: Use specific name for `Try` method's `[out]` parameters

## Cause

An `[out]` parameter of a `Try` method does not have a specific name.

## Rule description

When a `TryXyz` method includes an `[out]` parameter, name it specifically, as it is the actual result of the method.
The return value only indicates success or failure:
- For a `Try` method, name the `[out]` parameter `result`.
- For a `TryGet` method, name the `[out]` parameter based on the method's name, dropping the `TryGet` prefix.

For example, in the `TryGetMyValue` method, the parameter should be named `myValue`.
This keeps names precise and clear.

### Rationale behind

The `[out]` parameter in a `Try` method carries the actual result of the operation, while the return value only signals success or failure.
A well-named `[out]` parameter makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand.
Following a consistent naming pattern helps developers quickly understand what each parameter represents.

Using specific names for `[out]` parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Intent**:
  When the `[out]` parameter has a meaningful name, developers immediately understand what the method will produce.
  Generic names like `obj` or `value` do not provide this clarity.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Good parameter names reduce the need for comments and documentation.
  The method signature itself explains what it does.

- **Consistency**:
  Following the `result` pattern for `Try` methods and the entity name pattern for `TryGet` methods creates predictable code.
  Developers know what to expect across the entire codebase.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When using the method, IntelliSense shows the parameter name, helping developers understand what the method returns without looking at documentation.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly understand what the method does when parameters have clear, specific names.
  This speeds up the review process and reduces misunderstandings.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `[out]` parameter according to the method's purpose.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1061
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1061
