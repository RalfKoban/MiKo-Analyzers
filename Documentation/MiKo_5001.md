# MiKo_5001: Invoke `Debug` and `DebugFormat` methods only after checking `IsDebugEnabled`

## Cause

A `Debug` or `DebugFormat` method is called without first checking whether the debug log level is enabled.

## Rule description

To improve performance, call `IsDebugEnabled` before invoking `Debug` or `DebugFormat`.
This prevents creating unnecessary messages and garbage collection if the `Debug` log level is not set.

### Rationale behind

When logging frameworks process debug messages, they need to format the message and create string objects even if the debug level is disabled.
This creates unnecessary work for the application and puts pressure on the garbage collector.

Checking `IsDebugEnabled` before calling debug methods provides several important benefits:

- **Avoided String Creation**:
  Debug messages are often created by concatenating strings or formatting them.
  If the debug level is not enabled, these strings are created for nothing and immediately become garbage.

- **Reduced Garbage Collection Pressure**:
  By skipping unnecessary string allocations, the garbage collector has less work to do.
  This leads to better application performance, especially in scenarios with high logging activity.

- **Improved Performance**:
  Checking a boolean flag is much faster than creating strings and invoking the logging framework.
  Applications that log frequently can see measurable performance improvements.

- **Better Resource Usage**:
  Production environments typically run with debug logging disabled.
  By guarding debug calls, applications waste fewer CPU cycles and memory on operations that produce no output.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, wrap the debug logging call in an if statement that checks `IsDebugEnabled` first.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5001
```
