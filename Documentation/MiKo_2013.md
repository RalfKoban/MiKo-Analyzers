# MiKo_2013: Start Enum `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation for an enum does not start with a phrase that specifies the types of values it defines.

## Rule description

To make enums easier to use, they should clearly specify the types of values they define.
This adds clarity and helps developers understand their purpose more quickly.

### Rationale behind

Enums represent a fixed set of named values, and their documentation should immediately communicate what those values represent.
Using a consistent pattern like `Specifies` or `Defines` makes it instantly clear that the type is an enumeration of related values.

Following standard enum documentation patterns provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Type Recognition**:
  Starting enum documentation with `Specifies` or `Defines` immediately tells developers they are working with an enumeration.
  This is especially helpful when browsing through IntelliSense or API documentation.

- **Clear Purpose Statement**:
  The documentation immediately communicates what kind of values the enum represents.
  Developers understand the enum's purpose without needing to examine its individual members.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework uses phrases like `Specifies` for enum documentation throughout the base class library.
  Following the same pattern creates consistency with framework enums.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When developers see an enum parameter in IntelliSense, clear documentation helps them understand what values are expected.
  This speeds up development and reduces errors.

- **Simplified Learning**:
  Consistent enum documentation helps new developers understand the codebase more quickly.
  They can rely on predictable patterns across all enums in the application.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Following established conventions demonstrates attention to quality and alignment with .NET best practices.
  This makes the code appear more polished and well-maintained.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the enum documentation to start with a standard phrase.

Use `Specifies` or `Defines` followed by a description of what the enum values represent.
For example: `Specifies the types of database connections supported.` or `Defines the possible states of a workflow.`

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2013
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2013
```
