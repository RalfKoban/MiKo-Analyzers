# MiKo_3035: Always specify timeouts with `WaitOne` methods

## Cause

A call to a `WaitOne` method does not specify a timeout value.

## Rule description

`WaitOne` methods are used to wait for a specific situation to occur.
Waiting indefinitely can lead to deadlocks or livelocks.
To prevent this, provide a `TimeSpan` to `WaitOne` to allow the wait to time out.
This ensures better control and avoids potential blocking issues, keeping the system responsive and efficient.

### Rationale behind

Waiting indefinitely on synchronization primitives is a common source of application hangs and poor user experience.
Without timeouts, a thread can wait forever if the expected condition never occurs, leaving the application unresponsive.

Always specifying timeouts provides several important benefits:

- **Deadlock Prevention**:
  Timeouts provide a way to recover from situations where the expected signal never arrives.
  Without timeouts, threads can block indefinitely, causing complete application hangs.

- **Improved Responsiveness**:
  Applications can detect when operations are taking too long and respond appropriately.
  This keeps the user interface responsive and provides better feedback to users.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When waits time out, it becomes obvious that something is wrong.
  Infinite waits can make problems appear as random hangs that are difficult to reproduce and diagnose.

- **Better Resource Management**:
  Timeouts allow threads to periodically check whether they should continue waiting or give up.
  This prevents resources from being tied up indefinitely in hopeless waits.

- **Graceful Degradation**:
  When operations time out, the application can handle the situation gracefully.
  This might involve logging errors, retrying, or notifying the user, rather than hanging silently.

- **Testability**:
  Code with explicit timeouts is easier to test because tests can verify timeout behavior.
  Infinite waits make tests hang, requiring special handling or causing test suite failures.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a `TimeSpan` parameter to the `WaitOne` call.
Choose a timeout value appropriate for the expected operation duration.
Handle the case where the wait times out by checking the return value of `WaitOne`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3035
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3035
```
