# MiKo_1085: Do not suffix parameters with a number

## Cause

A parameter name ends with a number.

## Rule description

Parameter names should not end with numbers, especially when the type already contains a number suffix.
When a type contains a number (like `IProjectManager42`), the parameter name should omit that number (use `projectManager` instead of `projectManager42`).
Even when the type does not have a number, using numbered parameter names like `value1` and `value2` provides no meaningful information about what the parameter represents.
Clear and descriptive parameter names make methods easier to understand and use.

### Rationale behind

Numbered parameter suffixes create two common problems in code.

First, when the type already has a number suffix (like `IProjectManager42`), repeating that number in the parameter name (`projectManager42`) creates unnecessary redundancy.
The type name already conveys the version or variant, so the parameter name should simply be `projectManager`.

Second, generic numbered parameters like `value1` and `value2` tell developers nothing about what the parameters are for.
Descriptive names like `firstName` and `lastName` immediately convey the purpose and expected content of each parameter.
This makes the code self-documenting and reduces the chance of passing arguments in the wrong order.

Using descriptive parameter names without number suffixes provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Descriptive names like `firstName` and `lastName` immediately communicate what each parameter represents.
  `projectManager` is clearer than `projectManager42` when the type is already `IProjectManager42`.
  Developers do not have to guess or check the method implementation to understand how to use it.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Well-named parameters act as inline documentation, making it clear what values should be passed to the method.
  This reduces the need for additional comments or documentation.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  When the type has a number suffix, repeating it in the parameter name serves no purpose.
  The type already indicates the version, dimensionality, or variant.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When parameters have meaningful names, developers are less likely to pass arguments in the wrong order.
  Numbered parameters make it easy to confuse `value1` with `value2`.

- **Better IntelliSense Support**:
  When calling a method, descriptive parameter names in IntelliSense tooltips help developers understand what values to provide.
  Numbers provide no such guidance.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When modifying or debugging code, descriptive parameter names make it easier to understand what the method does.
  Developers can quickly grasp the method's purpose without reading extensive documentation.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  If a type changes from `IProjectManager42` to `IProjectManager43`, a parameter named `projectManager` does not need to be renamed.
  A parameter named `projectManager42` would need updating throughout the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the number from the parameter name and use a descriptive name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1085
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1085
```
