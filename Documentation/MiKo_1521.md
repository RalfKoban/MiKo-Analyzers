# MiKo_1521: Do not prefix or suffix parameters with `toCopy`

## Cause

A parameter name contains `toCopy` as a prefix or suffix.

## Rule description

Use `original` (or 'source`) as a parameter name when passing an object to be copied, because it clearly indicates that it's the source of the data.
Avoid names like `toCopy`, which can be misleading and suggest it's the target instead.
Clear and conventional naming improves readability and reduces confusion.

Using standard, descriptive names helps developers immediately understand the purpose and role of parameters.

### Rationale behind

Parameter names form part of a method's public contract and should clearly communicate the role each parameter plays.
The phrase `to copy` creates ambiguity that can lead to incorrect usage and bugs.

Using `original` (or 'source`) instead provides several important benefits:

- **Unambiguous Method Contract**:
  A method signature like `Clone(object original)` clearly indicates that the parameter is the source object.
  `Clone(object toCopy)` is ambiguous - is it the source or destination of the copy operation?

- **Better IntelliSense Guidance**:
  When developers use your methods, IntelliSense shows parameter names.
  `original` (or 'source`) immediately tells them to pass the source object, while `toCopy` might confuse them.

- **Reduced API Misuse**:
  Clear parameter names reduce the likelihood of developers passing arguments in the wrong order or with incorrect intent.
  This is especially important for methods with multiple parameters.

- **Consistency with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET Framework and common libraries use terminology like 'source` or `original` for copy operations.
  Following these conventions makes your API feel familiar and professional.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Code at call sites becomes more readable: `result = Clone(original)` is clearer than `result = Clone(toCopy)`.
  The parameter name serves as inline documentation.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly understand the flow of data in copy operations when parameters have clear, conventional names.
  Ambiguous names slow down reviews and increase the risk of missing logic errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to use `original` (or 'source`) instead of `toCopy`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1521
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1521
