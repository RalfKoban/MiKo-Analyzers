# MiKo_3218: Define extension methods in expected places

## Cause

An extension method is defined in a type that is not a static class specifically designed for extension methods.

## Rule description

Extension methods should only be in static types designed for that purpose.
Avoid placing them in other types, as this can cause confusion.
Keeping extension methods where they belong ensures clarity and consistency in your code.

### Rationale behind

Extension methods are a special language feature that allows adding methods to existing types.
They should be organized in dedicated static classes to make them easy to find and understand.

Defining extension methods in expected places provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers know where to look for extension methods.
  They are organized in dedicated classes with clear purposes.

- **Better Organization**:
  Grouping related extension methods together improves code organization.
  The structure reflects how the extensions are used.

- **Enhanced Clarity**:
  Extension method classes have obvious names that indicate their purpose.
  There is no confusion about what the class contains.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Mixing extension methods with other code creates confusion.
  Dedicated classes make the code structure clearer.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Extension methods in predictable locations are easier to find and modify.
  Developers can locate them without searching through unrelated code.

- **Consistent Conventions**:
  Following standard practices for organizing extension methods aligns with .NET conventions.
  This makes the codebase more familiar to other developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the extension method to a static class specifically designed for extension methods.
Name the class to clearly indicate it contains extensions (e.g., `StringExtensions`, `EnumerableExtensions`).
Ensure the static class only contains extension methods and related helper methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3218
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3218
```
