# MiKo_2017: Document dependency properties as done by the .NET Framework

## Cause

A dependency property documentation does not follow the .NET Framework's documentation style.

## Rule description

Dependency properties should follow the same documentation style used by the .NET Framework.
This consistency ensures clarity and makes it easier for developers to understand and work with these properties.

### Rationale behind

Dependency properties are a core feature of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and have specific characteristics that differ from regular CLR properties.
The .NET Framework uses a particular documentation style for dependency properties that clearly communicates their nature and usage.

Following framework documentation conventions provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework documents dependency properties with standard phrases that identify the dependency property identifier field.
  Using the same pattern makes custom dependency properties feel like native WPF properties.

- **Clear Property Identification**:
  Standard documentation helps developers immediately recognize dependency properties and understand how they differ from regular properties.
  This is important because dependency properties support features like data binding, animations, and property value inheritance.

- **Identifier Field Reference**:
  Dependency property documentation typically references the associated identifier field (usually named with a `Property` suffix).
  This helps developers find the field needed for advanced scenarios like property metadata or coercion.

- **Established Patterns**:
  WPF developers are familiar with framework-style dependency property documentation.
  Following the same pattern leverages this existing knowledge and reduces confusion.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  Consistent documentation style provides predictable information in IntelliSense tooltips.
  Developers know what to expect and can quickly understand how to use the property.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Following established WPF documentation conventions demonstrates adherence to framework best practices.
  This makes the codebase appear more professional and well-designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the dependency property documentation to follow the .NET Framework style.

Include a reference to the dependency property identifier field and follow the documentation pattern used by framework dependency properties.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2017
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2017
```
