# MiKo_1086: Do not use numbers as slang in method names

## Cause

A method name contains numbers used as slang (like `2` for `to` or `4` for `for`).

## Rule description

Method names that use numbers as slang replacements for words are unprofessional and harder to read.
Examples include using `2` instead of `To` or `4` instead of `For`.
Proper words should always be used instead.

### Rationale behind

Using numbers as slang in method names (like `Send2You` or `Do4You`) makes code look unprofessional and can confuse developers, especially those who are not native English speakers.
This practice originated from text messaging culture but has no place in professional code.
Clear, properly spelled method names ensure that everyone can understand the code regardless of their background.

Using proper words instead of number slang provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Professionalism**:
  Code that uses proper spelling appears more professional and maintains high quality standards.
  Slang abbreviations make code look casual or hastily written.

- **Better Readability**:
  Words are easier to read and understand than number substitutions.
  `SendToUser` is immediately clear, while `Send2User` requires mental translation.

- **Language Independence**:
  Number-word substitutions are based on English pronunciation and do not work in other languages.
  International development teams benefit from proper word usage.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Numbers in names should represent actual numeric values, not word substitutions.
  Mixing these concepts creates confusion about whether the number has meaning.

- **Consistent Standards**:
  Professional code follows established naming conventions that do not include text-speak or slang.
  Maintaining consistency across the codebase improves overall code quality.

- **Easier Code Search**:
  Searching for methods with proper spelling is easier than trying to guess which slang abbreviations were used.
  Tools and search engines work better with standard spelling.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the slang number with the correct word.
