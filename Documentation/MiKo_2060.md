# MiKo_2060: Document factories uniformly

## Cause

Factory method or factory class documentation is not uniform.

## Rule description

The documentation of factories should be uniform and consistent to ensure that all factory methods and classes follow the same documentation pattern.

### Rationale behind

Factory methods and factory classes are a common design pattern in .NET, used to encapsulate object creation logic.
Using consistent documentation for factories helps developers immediately recognize factory patterns and understand how to use them to create objects.

Documenting factories uniformly provides several important benefits:

- **Pattern Recognition**:
  Consistent factory documentation makes it easy for developers to recognize the factory pattern.
  This helps them understand the code's design and architecture more quickly.

- **Clear Creation Intent**:
  Uniform documentation makes it immediately clear that the method or class is responsible for creating objects.
  Developers can quickly find factory methods when they need to create instances.

- **Consistent Usage Guidance**:
  When factory documentation follows a standard pattern, developers receive consistent guidance on how to create objects.
  This improves the overall API usability.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  Consistently documented factories are easier to discover through documentation searches.
  Developers can locate factory methods more easily when they need to create specific types of objects.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Uniform documentation demonstrates attention to detail and adherence to design patterns.
  This makes the codebase feel more professional and well-organized.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  When factory documentation follows a consistent pattern, it is easier to maintain and update.
  Changes to factory behavior can be documented consistently across the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update factory method or factory class documentation to follow a uniform pattern.
Ensure that all factories use consistent phrasing to describe their purpose and what objects they create.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2060
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2060
```
