# MiKo_1406: Place value converters in `Converters` namespace

## Cause

A value converter class is not placed in a namespace ending with `Converters`.

## Rule description

Value converters (classes implementing `IValueConverter` or `IMultiValueConverter`) should be organized in a namespace ending with `Converters` for better discoverability and organization.

### Rationale behind

Organizing value converters in a dedicated `Converters` namespace is essential for maintainability in WPF and similar XAML-based applications.
Converters are a specific type of infrastructure component used throughout UI layers, and having a predictable location for them dramatically improves discoverability.

Organizing converters in a dedicated namespace provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers know exactly where to find converters when they need them.
  This prevents wasted time searching through various namespaces.

- **Prevention of Duplication**:
  A central Converters namespace serves as a catalog of all available conversions.
  Developers can browse existing converters before creating new ones, avoiding duplicate functionality.

- **Easier Reuse**: When converters are well-organized, it is simple to reuse existing converters across different parts of the application.
  This reduces code duplication and improves consistency.

- **Consistent Patterns**:
  A dedicated namespace makes it easier to apply consistent patterns and coding standards across all converters.
  This improves code quality and maintainability.

- **Better Testing Strategy**:
  When converters are organized together, it is easier to ensure they all have proper test coverage.
  Testing strategies can be applied consistently across all converters.

- **Simplified Refactoring**:
  A well-organized Converters namespace makes it easier to identify opportunities for consolidation.
  Common patterns can be extracted and duplicate code can be eliminated.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Changes to converter logic are easier to manage when all converters are in a predictable location.
  This reduces maintenance overhead over time.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the value converter to a namespace ending with `Converters`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1406
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1406
```
