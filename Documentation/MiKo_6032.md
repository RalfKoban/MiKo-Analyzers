# MiKo_6032: Position multi-line parameters outdented at end of method

## Cause

Multi-line parameters at the end of a method are not outdented below the method declaration.

## Rule description

Outdent multi-line parameters below the method declaration to easily spot them.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Outdenting multi-line parameters at the end of method declarations is important for maintaining clear visual separation between the method signature and complex parameter expressions.
When long or complex parameters are outdented, they stand out from the method name and other parameters, making the method declaration easier to read and understand.

Positioning multi-line parameters outdented at end of method provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Parameter Visibility**:
  Outdenting makes complex multi-line parameters stand out from the method signature.
  Developers can immediately identify where parameter expressions begin.

- **Improved Readability**:
  When parameters are outdented, the method declaration is easier to read.
  The visual separation prevents parameter expressions from blending into the method name.

- **Better Visual Structure**:
  Outdentation creates a clear visual hierarchy between the method signature and parameter details.
  This helps developers understand the overall structure at a glance.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Outdented parameters are easier to locate when scanning through method declarations.
  The distinct positioning acts as a visual marker for complex parameter expressions.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Clear separation prevents confusion between the method name and its parameters.
  Developers can quickly distinguish between the method declaration and parameter values.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When parameters are clearly separated, modifying them is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where parameter expressions begin and end.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, outdent the multi-line parameters below the method declaration.
Position them at a lower indentation level than the method signature to create visual separation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6032
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6032
```
