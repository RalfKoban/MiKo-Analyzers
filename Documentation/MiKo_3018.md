# MiKo_3018: Throw ObjectDisposedExceptions on public methods of disposable types

## Cause

A public method of a disposable type does not throw an `ObjectDisposedException` when the object has been disposed.

## Rule description

Already disposed instances of disposable types should throw `ObjectDisposedException`s when methods are invoked on them.
This practice makes it easier to identify bugs, as user code should never access already disposed types.
Ensuring this indication helps maintain code integrity and prevents unintended errors.

### Rationale behind

Accessing disposed objects can lead to unpredictable behavior, resource leaks, and difficult-to-diagnose bugs.
Without explicit checks, disposed objects might appear to work but operate on invalid state.

Throwing `ObjectDisposedException` on disposed objects provides several important benefits:

- **Fail-Fast Behavior**:
  Throwing exceptions immediately when disposed objects are accessed prevents subtle bugs.
  Developers catch mistakes early rather than discovering them later through unexpected behavior.

- **Clearer Error Messages**:
  `ObjectDisposedException` clearly communicates that the object is no longer usable.
  This is more informative than unexpected null references or corrupted state.

- **Better Resource Management**:
  Explicit disposal checks encourage proper resource lifecycle management.
  Developers learn to structure code that respects object lifetimes.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When `ObjectDisposedException` is thrown, the problem is immediately clear.
  Without it, bugs might manifest in unrelated parts of the code.

- **Consistent API Behavior**:
  .NET Framework classes throw `ObjectDisposedException` when accessed after disposal.
  Following this pattern makes custom types behave consistently with the framework.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a check at the beginning of public methods that throws an `ObjectDisposedException` if the object has been disposed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3018
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3018
```
