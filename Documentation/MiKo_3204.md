# MiKo_3204: Invert negative if statements when they have an else clause

## Cause

An `if` statement has a negative condition and an `else` clause.

## Rule description

If an `if` statement has a negative condition and an `else` clause, invert it into a positive condition.
This makes the method easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Negative conditions in `if` statements require more mental effort to understand than positive conditions.
When an `else` clause is present, the condition can be inverted to make the logic flow more naturally.

Inverting negative `if` statements provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Positive conditions are easier to understand at a glance.
  Developers do not need to mentally negate the condition.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Reading positive conditions requires less mental effort.
  The code's logic becomes more immediately obvious.

- **Better Comprehension**:
  Positive phrasing aligns with natural thinking patterns.
  This makes the code more intuitive to read.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Positive conditions more clearly communicate what is being tested.
  The purpose of the condition is more obvious.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code with positive conditions is easier to modify correctly.
  There is less chance of introducing logic errors during updates.

- **Natural Flow**:
  Positive conditions create a more natural progression through the code.
  The main case appears first, followed by alternative cases.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, invert the negative condition to make it positive.
Swap the content of the `if` and `else` blocks to match the inverted condition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3204
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3204
```
