# MiKo_1114: Do not name test methods `HappyPath` or `BadPath`

## Cause

A test method name contains `HappyPath` or `BadPath`.

## Rule description

Using `HappyPath` or `BadPath` in test method names is vague and does not describe what the test actually validates.
Be specific about what scenario is being tested.

### Rationale behind

Avoiding generic terms like `HappyPath` or `BadPath` is important for test clarity and documentation.

Using specific test names instead of `HappyPath` or `BadPath` provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Specific names like `Save_succeeds_for_valid_user` immediately communicate what scenario is being validated, while `Save_HappyPath` requires reading the test code to understand what it checks.

- **Better Failure Diagnosis**:
  When a test fails, a descriptive name tells developers exactly what functionality broke.
  `HappyPath` or `BadPath` provides no useful information about the failure.

- **Improved Documentation**:
  Test names serve as living documentation of system behavior.
  Specific names document actual requirements and edge cases, while generic terms add no value.

- **Easier Test Discovery**:
  When looking for tests that cover specific scenarios, descriptive names make it easy to find relevant tests.
  Generic names like `HappyPath` hide what scenarios are actually covered.

- **More Professional Code**:
  Using precise, descriptive names demonstrates care and professionalism, making the codebase feel more mature and well-maintained.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Terms like `HappyPath` can mean different things to different developers.
  Explicit names eliminate this ambiguity and ensure everyone understands what the test validates.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test method to specifically describe what is being tested.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1114
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1114
