# MiKo_1013: Do not name methods `Notify` or `OnNotify`

## Cause

A method is named `Notify` or `OnNotify`.

## Rule description

Seeing `Notify` in a method name often means an event is being raised.
In these cases, it is better to use the prefix `On` instead.
For example, instead of `NotifyPropertyChanged`, use `OnPropertyChanged`.
This makes it clearer that an event is being triggered.

The `On` prefix is the standard .NET convention for methods that raise events, making the code more consistent with framework patterns.

### Rationale behind

Using `On` instead of `Notify` for event-raising methods aligns code with established .NET Framework conventions and improves readability.
The `On` prefix is the universally recognized pattern in .NET for methods that trigger or respond to events, as seen throughout the framework (e.g., `OnClick`, `OnPropertyChanged`, `OnLoad`).
While `Notify` is not incorrect, it is less specific and does not follow the standard pattern that .NET developers expect.

The `On` prefix creates a consistent, predictable naming scheme that makes it immediately obvious which methods are event-related.
This consistency is particularly valuable in large codebases where multiple developers need to quickly understand the purpose of methods.
Additionally, many .NET frameworks and patterns (like WPF's MVVM pattern) specifically use `On` prefixed methods (e.g., `OnPropertyChanged`), so using `Notify` creates unnecessary inconsistency with these established patterns.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The `On` prefix is the universal .NET pattern for event-raising methods.
  Using it makes code feel integrated with the platform.

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  Developers instantly recognize `On` prefixed methods as event-related.
  This pattern recognition speeds up code comprehension.

- **Better Code Scannability**:
  All event-raising methods can be easily identified by the `On` prefix.
  This uniformity improves code navigation and review.

- **MVVM Pattern Alignment**:
  WPF, UWP, and other frameworks use `On` prefixed methods (e.g., OnPropertyChanged).
  Following this pattern ensures consistency with common design patterns.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Using the standard `On` prefix eliminates ambiguity about method purpose.
  Developers do not need to learn project-specific naming conventions.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Adhering to established .NET conventions signals well-designed, professional code.
  It demonstrates understanding of platform best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename methods using `Notify` to use the `On` prefix followed by the event name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1013
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1013
