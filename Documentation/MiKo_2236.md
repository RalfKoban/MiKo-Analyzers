# MiKo_2236: Use `for example` instead of abbreviation `e.g.` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains the abbreviation `e.g.` instead of the full phrase `for example`.

## Rule description

Non-native speakers need to learn abbreviations like `e.g.` to understand them.
Therefore, using `for example` is preferable because it directly conveys the intended meaning without requiring additional learning.

### Rationale behind

Abbreviations like `e.g.` create unnecessary barriers to understanding, especially for developers who are not native English speakers or who are not familiar with Latin abbreviations.
Using clear, unabbreviated language makes documentation accessible to everyone.

Using `for example` instead of `e.g.` provides several important benefits:

- **Better Accessibility**:
  Not all developers know that `e.g.` stands for `exempli gratia` or means `for example`.
  Using the full phrase makes documentation immediately understandable to everyone.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  New developers or those learning English do not need to memorize Latin abbreviations to understand the documentation.
  This lowers the barrier to entry.

- **Clearer Communication**:
  `For example` is explicit and leaves no room for confusion.
  Abbreviations require readers to mentally translate them, adding unnecessary cognitive load.

- **Professional Quality**:
  While `e.g.` is common, using full phrases demonstrates a commitment to clear communication.
  This makes documentation more professional and inclusive.

- **Avoids Confusion with `i.e.`**:
  Many people confuse `e.g.` (for example) with `i.e.` (that is).
  Using the full phrase eliminates this source of confusion entirely.

- **Better Readability**:
  Full phrases flow more naturally in sentences than abbreviations.
  This makes documentation easier to read and understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the abbreviation `e.g.` with the full phrase `for example` in documentation.
