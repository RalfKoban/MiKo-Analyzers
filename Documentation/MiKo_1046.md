# MiKo_1046: Follow Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) for asynchronous methods

## Cause

An asynchronous method using the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern does not end with the suffix `Async`.

## Rule description

To make maintenance easier, methods using the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) should end with the suffix `Async`.
This helps clearly identify them as asynchronous methods.

The `Async` suffix is a convention used throughout the .NET Framework for asynchronous methods.
It helps developers immediately recognize that a method performs asynchronous operations and returns a `Task` or `Task<T>`.

### Rationale behind

Asynchronous methods have different behavior and calling conventions than synchronous methods.
They must be awaited or their `Task` result must be handled properly to avoid bugs.
The `Async` suffix provides a visual indicator that helps developers use these methods correctly.

Using the `Async` suffix for asynchronous methods provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Common Mistakes**:
  The `Async` suffix reminds developers that the method must be awaited or its `Task` must be handled.
  Without this suffix, developers might forget to await the method, leading to subtle bugs.

- **Consistency with .NET Standards**:
  The .NET Framework uses the `Async` suffix consistently across all asynchronous APIs.
  Following this convention makes the code feel familiar and predictable.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Developers can immediately see which methods are asynchronous just by reading the code.
  This makes it easier to understand the flow of asynchronous operations.

- **Clear Distinction from Synchronous Methods**:
  Many APIs provide both synchronous and asynchronous versions of the same operation.
  The `Async` suffix makes it clear which version is being called (for example, `Read` versus `ReadAsync`).

- **Better Tooling Support**:
  Code analysis tools, IDEs, and other development tools expect asynchronous methods to follow this naming convention.
  Using it ensures better warnings and suggestions from these tools.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly identify asynchronous code paths and verify they are being handled correctly.
  This makes code reviews more effective at catching concurrency issues.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to check method signatures or hover over method names to determine if they are asynchronous.
  The name itself provides this information immediately.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the asynchronous method to include the `Async` suffix.

For example, rename `LoadData` to `LoadDataAsync`, or `SaveDocument` to `SaveDocumentAsync`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1046
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1046
```
