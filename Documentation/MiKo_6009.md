# MiKo_6009: Surround try statements with blank lines

## Cause

`try` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `try` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `try` statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear code structure and improving readability.
Try-catch blocks represent error handling sections that are distinct from normal execution flow, and visually separating them helps developers understand where exception handling begins and how it relates to the surrounding business logic.

Surrounding try statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Error Handling Visibility**:
  Blank lines make try-catch blocks stand out as exception handling sections.
  Developers can immediately identify where error handling occurs in the code.

- **Improved Code Organization**:
  Visual separation creates distinct sections for normal flow and error handling.
  This helps developers understand the relationship between business logic and exception handling.

- **Better Readability**:
  When try statements are visually separated, the code structure is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal a transition from normal code to error-handling code.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Visually distinct try-catch blocks are easier to locate when navigating through code.
  Developers can quickly find exception handling sections without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated try-catch blocks are easier to work with during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify where exceptions might be caught and how they are handled.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When try statements are clearly separated, modifying exception handling is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where error handling logic resides.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `try` statements.
Ensure each try-catch block is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6009
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6009
```
