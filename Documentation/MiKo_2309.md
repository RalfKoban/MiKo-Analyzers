# MiKo_2309: Do not use contraction "n't" in comments

## Cause

A comment uses the contraction "n't" (such as "don't", "can't", "won't") instead of the full form "not".

## Rule description

Sometimes, contractions are missed, causing unintentional errors.
To prevent this, it is best to avoid them entirely.

### Rationale behind

Contractions like "n't" can be easily overlooked when scanning code, especially by non-native English speakers.
Using the full word "not" makes comments clearer and more universally understandable.

Avoiding contractions in comments provides several important benefits:

- **Better Clarity**:
  The full word "not" is more explicit and easier to spot when scanning comments.
  Contractions can be missed or misread, especially in dense code.

- **Easier for Non-Native Speakers**:
  Not all developers are native English speakers.
  Contractions can be more difficult to parse for those learning English as a second language.

- **Prevents Misreading**:
  Contractions are smaller and can be overlooked when reading quickly.
  Using "not" makes the negative meaning more visible and obvious.

- **More Professional Tone**:
  Avoiding contractions gives comments a more formal, professional tone.
  This is appropriate for technical documentation and code.

- **Consistent Style**:
  When the codebase avoids contractions consistently, it creates a uniform style.
  This makes the code appear more polished and well-maintained.

- **Reduces Errors**:
  Developers reading quickly might miss contractions, leading to misunderstandings about what the code does.
  Using "not" explicitly reduces this risk.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace contractions that use "n't" with the full form using "not" in comments.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_2309
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2309
