# MiKo_4107: Place assembly-wide test cleanup methods directly after assembly-wide test initialization methods

## Cause

An assembly-wide test cleanup method is not placed directly after the assembly-wide test initialization methods.

## Rule description

Assembly-wide test cleanup methods handle the common tasks that must be executed after all tests are done to clean up the test assembly.
To make them easy to find, place them directly after the assembly-wide test initialization methods.

### Rationale behind

Assembly-wide test cleanup methods are responsible for releasing resources, disposing of objects, and cleaning up the test environment after all tests have completed.
They work as counterparts to initialization methods and should be placed immediately after them to show this relationship clearly.
This pairing makes it obvious which cleanup corresponds to which initialization.

Placing cleanup methods directly after initialization methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  When cleanup methods follow initialization methods, the setup and teardown logic is grouped together.
  This makes it easy to see the complete lifecycle of the test assembly at a glance.

- **Better Understanding of Resource Management**:
  Seeing initialization and cleanup methods side by side helps developers understand how resources are acquired and released.
  This pairing makes it clear what needs to be cleaned up and ensures nothing is forgotten.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When initialization or cleanup logic needs to be modified, having both methods next to each other makes it easier to keep them synchronized.
  Changes to setup often require corresponding changes to cleanup, and proximity makes this relationship obvious.

- **Clearer Test Structure**:
  A well-organized test class follows a logical pattern: initialization first, cleanup second, then the actual tests.
  This structure is intuitive and makes the code easier to navigate and understand.

- **Reduced Risk of Resource Leaks**:
  When cleanup methods are consistently placed after initialization methods, it is easier to verify that all resources are properly released.
  This consistent structure helps prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  During code reviews, having cleanup methods directly after initialization methods makes it simple to verify that the cleanup properly reverses the setup.
  Reviewers can quickly confirm that resources are being managed correctly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the assembly-wide test cleanup method so it appears directly after the assembly-wide test initialization methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4107
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4107
```
