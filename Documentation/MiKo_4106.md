# MiKo_4106: Place assembly-wide test initialization methods before all other methods

## Cause

An assembly-wide test initialization method is not placed before all other methods.

## Rule description

Assembly-wide test initialization methods set up the key parts of the test assembly.
To make them easy to find, place these methods first, before all other methods.

### Rationale behind

Assembly-wide test initialization methods are critical for setting up the test environment before any tests run.
They configure resources, initialize dependencies, and prepare the test assembly for execution.
Placing these methods at the top of the class makes them immediately visible and easier to locate.

Having a consistent placement for assembly-wide test initialization methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  When initialization methods are always placed first, developers can quickly find the setup logic without searching through the entire class.
  This consistency makes the code structure predictable and easier to navigate.

- **Better Understanding of Test Dependencies**:
  Seeing initialization methods first helps developers understand what dependencies and configurations the tests rely on before reading the actual test code.
  This context makes it easier to understand how the tests work.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When assembly-wide initialization needs to be updated or debugged, having it in a consistent location saves time.
  Developers do not need to search through the file to find where the setup happens.

- **Clearer Test Structure**:
  A well-organized test class with initialization methods at the top follows a logical flow: setup first, then cleanup, then the actual tests.
  This structure makes the code more intuitive and professional.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  A consistent ordering pattern means developers do not need to remember where initialization methods might be located.
  This reduces mental effort and allows focus on understanding the test logic itself.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  During code reviews, having initialization methods in a predictable location makes it easier to verify that the setup is correct and complete.
  Reviewers can quickly assess whether the test assembly is properly configured.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the assembly-wide test initialization method to the beginning of the class, before all other methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4106
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4106
```
