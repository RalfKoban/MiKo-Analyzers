# MiKo_1075: Do not suffix non-`System.EventArgs` types with `EventArgs`

## Cause

A type that does not inherit from `System.EventArgs` ends with the suffix `EventArgs`.

## Rule description

Event argument types should inherit from `System.EventArgs` and have names ending with `EventArgs`.
If a type ends with `EventArgs` but does not follow this pattern, it is misleading and should not use `EventArgs` in its name.

### Rationale behind

The `EventArgs` suffix in .NET has a specific meaning established by framework design guidelines.
It signals that a type inherits from `System.EventArgs` and is used to carry event data in the standard .NET event pattern.

When types that do not inherit from `System.EventArgs` use this suffix, it creates confusion and breaks developer expectations.
Developers seeing a type with `EventArgs` in the name will assume it follows the standard event pattern, leading to misunderstandings and potential errors.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Framework Usage**:
  Following .NET naming conventions makes code more predictable and easier for developers familiar with the framework to understand.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `EventArgs` suffix should only be used for types that actually participate in the .NET event pattern, making the code's intent immediately clear.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Developers do not need to wonder whether a type follows the standard event pattern or if it is something else that just happens to have a misleading name.

- **Better Code Maintainability**:
  When event-related types are clearly identified, it is easier to understand the event flow in the application and make changes safely.

- **Improved Interoperability**:
  Tools and frameworks that work with .NET events expect types with `EventArgs` suffix to inherit from `System.EventArgs`, avoiding potential issues.

- **Enhanced Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that event patterns are implemented correctly when naming follows established conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `EventArgs` suffix from types that do not inherit from `System.EventArgs`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1075
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1075
