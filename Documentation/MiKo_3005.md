# MiKo_3005: Follow Trier-Doer-Pattern for methods named `Try`

## Cause

A method whose name starts with `Try` does not follow the Trier-Doer pattern.

## Rule description

`Try` methods should follow the Try-Doer pattern to ease maintenance.
They should return a Boolean and use the last parameter as an `[out]` parameter for the result.
If successful, the method returns `true` and provides valid output; otherwise, it returns `false`.
This pattern keeps methods consistent and predictable, enhancing readability and reliability.

### Rationale behind

Methods that start with `Try` but do not follow the standard pattern confuse developers and make the API harder to use correctly.
The Try-Doer pattern is a well-established .NET convention that developers expect and understand.

Following the Try-Doer pattern provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  The Try-Doer pattern is used throughout the .NET Framework.
  Following it ensures the API behaves like familiar framework methods such as `int.TryParse`.

- **Better Error Handling**:
  The pattern separates success indication from result values.
  This makes it clear when an operation fails without requiring exception handling.

- **Enhanced Performance**:
  Try methods typically avoid throwing exceptions for expected failures.
  This results in better performance compared to exception-based error handling.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The boolean return value explicitly communicates whether the operation succeeded.
  Developers can easily check the result and handle both success and failure cases.

- **Easier Testing**:
  The pattern makes it straightforward to test both success and failure scenarios.
  Tests can verify the return value and output parameter independently.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the method to return a boolean indicating success or failure, and use an `[out]` parameter for the result.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3005
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3005
```
