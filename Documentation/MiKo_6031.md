# MiKo_6031: Place question and colon tokens of ternary operators directly below the corresponding condition

## Cause

The question and colon tokens of ternary operators are not placed directly below the condition.

## Rule description

Place the question and colon tokens directly below the condition in ternary operators.
This makes the two possibilities easy to spot, improves readability, and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Aligning ternary operator tokens below the condition is crucial for maintaining readable multi-line conditional expressions.
When the `?` and `:` tokens are aligned below the condition, it creates a clear visual structure that makes the three parts of the ternary expression (condition, true result, false result) immediately apparent.

Placing question and colon tokens of ternary operators directly below the corresponding condition provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Ternary Structure Visibility**:
  Vertical alignment makes the three parts of the ternary expression immediately visible.
  Developers can quickly identify the condition, true branch, and false branch.

- **Improved Readability**:
  When tokens are aligned, multi-line ternary expressions are much easier to read.
  The visual structure guides the eye through the conditional logic naturally.

- **Better Visual Scanning**:
  Aligned tokens create a predictable pattern that is easy to scan.
  Developers can quickly locate the condition and the two possible results.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Clear alignment prevents confusion about which expressions belong to which part of the ternary.
  The structure makes the logic unambiguous.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  When debugging ternary expressions, aligned tokens make it easier to understand which branch is evaluated.
  The visual structure helps trace the logic flow.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Clearly structured ternary expressions are easier to modify.
  The alignment makes it obvious where to make changes to each part of the conditional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the `?` and `:` tokens directly below the start of the condition.
Align the tokens vertically to create a clear visual structure.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6031
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6031
```
