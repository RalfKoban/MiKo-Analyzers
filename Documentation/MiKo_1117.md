# MiKo_1117: Make test method names more precise

## Cause

A test method name is too vague or imprecise.

## Rule description

Test method names must clearly describe the specific scenario being tested and the exact expected outcome.
They should avoid vague terms like "correct", "successful", "done", or "finished", and generic phrases like "EventIsRaised" or "ExceptionThrown".

Such names fail to indicate which event or exception is involved, or what terms like "successful" or "finished" actually mean.
This forces readers to inspect the test body to understand the behavior.

Precise and descriptive names make tests self‑explanatory, improve debugging, and enhance the quality of test documentation.

### Rationale behind

Precise test naming is crucial for maintaining a healthy test suite and development workflow.

Making test names precise and specific provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  Vague names like `EventIsRaised` or `ExceptionThrown` leave developers guessing about which specific event or exception is being tested.
  Precise names like `PropertyChanged_event_is_raised_when_Name_changes` or `ArgumentNullException_is_thrown_when_abc_parameter_is_null` remove all ambiguity and immediately communicate what is being validated.

- **Faster Debugging**:
  When test names clearly describe the scenario being tested and the expected outcome, developers can immediately understand what functionality broke when a test fails, without needing to read the test implementation.
  This dramatically reduces debugging time.
  A failing test named `ArgumentNullException_is_thrown_when_abc_parameter_is_null` immediately tells you what went wrong, while `ExceptionThrown` tells you nothing.

- **Better Living Documentation**:
  Specific test names serve as executable documentation, providing examples of how the code should behave in different scenarios.
  This documentation is always accurate because it is the actual running tests.
  Names that specify the exact event or exception document the actual behavior.

- **Easier Continuous Integration Analysis**:
  When tests fail in continuous integration, precise names make failure reports immediately understandable, helping teams diagnose issues faster and with more confidence.
  A CI report showing `ExceptionThrown: FAILED` requires investigation, while `ArgumentNullException_is_thrown_when_abc_parameter_is_null: FAILED` provides immediate context.

- **Improved Test Design**:
  Well-named tests encourage better test design by making it obvious when a single test is trying to verify too many behaviors.
  This prompts developers to split them into focused, single-purpose tests.

- **Clearer Code Reviews**:
  During code reviews, precise test names allow reviewers to quickly understand what scenarios are being validated and whether test coverage is adequate.

- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**:
  When tests have specific, descriptive names, it is easier to determine which tests need updating when requirements change and which tests can be safely removed if they become obsolete.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test method to be more specific about what scenario is being tested and what the expected outcome is.
Include details about the exact event being raised or the exception being thrown.

For parameterized tests, ensure the name works correctly with all parameter values.
Let the parameters express the details instead of putting them into the name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1117
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1117
```
