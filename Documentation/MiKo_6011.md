# MiKo_6011: Surround lock statements with blank lines

## Cause

`lock` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `lock` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `lock` statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear code structure in multi-threaded applications.
Lock statements represent critical sections where thread synchronization occurs, and visually separating them helps developers understand where thread-safe operations begin and end, which is essential for reasoning about concurrent code behavior.

Surrounding lock statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Synchronization Visibility**:
  Blank lines make lock statements stand out as important synchronization points.
  Developers can immediately identify where thread-safe operations occur.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When `lock` statements are visually separated, concurrent code is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that the following code requires exclusive access to a resource.

- **Better Understanding of Critical Sections**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the boundaries of critical sections.
  This is essential for preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  Visually distinct lock statements are easier to locate when debugging concurrency issues.
  Developers can quickly find synchronization points to verify lock behavior.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  During code reviews, separated lock statements are easier to identify and verify.
  Reviewers can quickly check that synchronization is being used correctly.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When lock statements are clearly separated, modifying concurrent code is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where synchronization occurs, reducing the risk of introducing race conditions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `lock` statements.
Ensure each lock block is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6011
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6011
```
