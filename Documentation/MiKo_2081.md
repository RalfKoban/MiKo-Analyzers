# MiKo_2081: End public-visible read-only field `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation of a public-visible read-only field does not end with a phrase indicating it is read-only.

## Rule description

For public-visible read-only fields, the documentation should clearly state that the field is read-only.
This detail informs developers about the field's immutability and intended usage.

### Rationale behind

Read-only fields can only be assigned during initialization or in a constructor, making them effectively immutable after object construction.
This immutability is an important characteristic that affects how developers can and should use the field.

When documentation does not mention that a field is read-only, developers may not realize this constraint without examining the field declaration.
Making the read-only nature explicit in documentation helps developers understand the field's behavior immediately.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Immutability Communication**:
  Explicitly stating that a field is read-only helps developers understand they cannot modify it after initialization.

- **Better API Understanding**:
  Developers using a library can quickly grasp which fields are constants or immutable without reading source code.

- **Improved IntelliSense Information**:
  The read-only nature of the field is visible in IntelliSense tooltips, making it easier to use the API correctly.

- **Prevented Errors**:
  When developers know a field is read-only, they will not attempt to write code that tries to modify it.

- **Consistent Documentation**:
  Using a standard phrase for read-only fields creates a uniform pattern that is easy to recognize.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a phrase at the end of the documentation indicating that the field is read-only, such as `This field is read-only.`

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2081
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2081
```
