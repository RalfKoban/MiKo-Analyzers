# MiKo_2245: Wrap numbers with `<c>` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains numeric literals that are not wrapped in `<c>` tags.

## Rule description

Wrap numeric literals in `<c>` tags in XML documentation to clearly indicate code values.
This improves readability, ensures consistent formatting in IntelliSense and documentation tools, and avoids ambiguity between prose and code.

### Rationale behind

Numeric literals in documentation can be confused with prose when they are not properly marked as code.
Wrapping them in `<c>` tags makes it clear that they represent specific code values rather than just numbers in a sentence.

Wrapping numbers with `<c>` tags provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Code Identification**:
  When numbers are wrapped in `<c>` tags, it is immediately obvious that they represent specific code values or literals.
  This prevents confusion with numbers used in general prose.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  IntelliSense and documentation tools render `<c>` tags with special formatting (typically monospace font).
  This makes code values stand out visually and improves readability.

- **Better Documentation Quality**:
  Properly marking code values demonstrates attention to detail and understanding of documentation best practices.
  This makes the overall documentation more professional.

- **Improved Scannability**:
  When code values are visually distinct, developers can quickly scan documentation to find specific numeric values or constants.
  This improves productivity.

- **Prevents Ambiguity**:
  In some contexts, numbers in prose could be confused with code values or vice versa.
  Using `<c>` tags eliminates this ambiguity entirely.

- **Consistent with Other Code References**:
  Just as method names and type names are marked with tags, numeric literals should also be marked.
  This creates consistency in how code elements are documented.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, wrap numeric literals in XML documentation with `<c>` tags.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2245
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2245
```
