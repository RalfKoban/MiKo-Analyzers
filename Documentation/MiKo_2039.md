# MiKo_2039: Start extension method class `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

An extension method class `<summary>` documentation does not start with the default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation for a class that contains extension methods should begin with the phrase `Provides a set of <see langword="static"/> methods for...`
This format clearly describes the purpose of the class and its functionality, making the documentation straightforward and helpful for developers.

### Rationale behind

Extension method classes have a specific purpose in .NET: they provide additional functionality to existing types without modifying those types.
Using a consistent starting phrase for extension method class documentation helps developers immediately recognize the class as a container for extension methods.

Following a standard format for extension method class documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Class Recognition**:
  Starting with the standard phrase makes it immediately clear that the class contains extension methods.
  Developers can quickly identify extension method classes and understand their purpose.

- **Consistent .NET Conventions**:
  The .NET Framework uses this pattern for extension method classes, and following the same convention makes the codebase feel more aligned with .NET standards.
  This consistency improves the overall quality of the documentation.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  When extension method classes are consistently documented, developers can more easily discover extension methods for specific types.
  This improves the usability of the codebase.

- **Clear Purpose Statement**:
  The standard phrase clearly indicates what types the extension methods extend, making the class purpose immediately obvious.
  Developers do not need to examine the methods to understand what the class does.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Following the .NET Framework convention for extension method classes makes the documentation feel more professional and well-maintained.
  This consistency demonstrates adherence to best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the extension method class documentation with the phrase `Provides a set of <see langword="static"/> methods for...` followed by a description of what types the extension methods extend.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the purpose of the extension methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2039
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2039
```
