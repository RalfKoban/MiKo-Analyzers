# MiKo_1405: Do not include `Lib` in namespaces

## Cause

A namespace name includes `Lib` or `Library`.

## Rule description

The term `Lib` or `Library` in namespace names is redundant.
Every assembly is essentially a library, so including this term does not add meaningful information.

### Rationale behind

Including `Lib` or `Library` in namespace names adds no semantic value because all compiled code assemblies are libraries by nature.
This redundant terminology clutters namespace names without improving understanding or organization.

Removing `Lib` or `Library` from namespace names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Namespaces without redundant terms are shorter and easier to read.
  This reduces visual clutter and makes code more pleasant to work with.

- **Better Focus on Purpose**:
  Without the `Lib` noise, namespace names can focus on communicating actual functionality.
  This makes it clearer what the namespace contains and what it does.

- **Alignment with .NET Conventions**:
  The .NET Framework does not include `Lib` in namespace names (e.g., `System.Collections`, not `System.Lib.Collections`).
  Following this convention makes the code feel more professional and consistent with industry standards.

- **Enhanced Professionalism**:
  Clean, purposeful namespace names improve the overall impression of code quality.
  They make the codebase feel more polished and well-designed.

- **Higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio**:
  Eliminating redundant information helps maintain clear, meaningful names throughout the codebase.
  This principle applies broadly to all naming conventions.

- **Reduced Typing Effort**:
  Shorter namespaces mean less typing when using fully qualified names or writing using directives.
  This improves developer productivity.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove `Lib` or `Library` from the namespace name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1405
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1405
```
