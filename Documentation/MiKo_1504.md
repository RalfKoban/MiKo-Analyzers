# MiKo_1504: Do not suffix properties with `Counter`

## Cause

A property name ends with `Counter`.

## Rule description

Properties that return values but are suffixed with `Counter` are most likely not returning counters but counted values instead.
So they should be named accordingly.

Using precise naming helps developers understand what the property represents and improves code clarity.

### Rationale behind

Properties in .NET are meant to provide access to values, not objects that perform actions.
The suffix `Counter` incorrectly implies an active counting mechanism rather than a passive numeric value.

Using appropriate naming provides several important benefits:

- **Correct Semantics**:
  A property represents a state or value, not an action or mechanism.
  `Counter` suggests an object that counts, while the property actually holds the counted result.

- **Alignment with .NET Conventions**:
  The .NET Framework uses property names like `Count`, `Length`, or descriptive adjectives like `ItemsCounted`.
  Following this convention makes your code predictable and familiar to other developers.

- **Clear Data Type Expectations**:
  Properties suffixed with `Counter` might confuse developers about the return type.
  Is it an integer, a `Counter` object, or something else?
  Clear naming eliminates this ambiguity.

- **Better Code Readability**:
  Code that uses properties like `ProcessedItemsCount` or `ItemsCounted` is more readable than `ProcessedItemsCounter`.
  The former clearly communicates that you are accessing a numeric value.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  When maintaining code, developers need to quickly understand what each property represents.
  Accurate names reduce the time needed to understand the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the property to replace `Counter` with `Counted` or another appropriate term.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1504
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1504
```
