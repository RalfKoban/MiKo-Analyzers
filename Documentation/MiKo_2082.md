# MiKo_2082: Use distinct phrases for Enum member `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation of an Enum member uses phrases like `Defines`, `Indicates`, or `Specifies` that are typically used for the Enum type itself.

## Rule description

The `<summary>` documentation of an Enum member should avoid phrases used in the Enum's own summary - like `Defines`, `Indicates`, or `Specifies.`
Instead, it should focus on describing the meaning and purpose of the individual member, providing clear and specific details.
This ensures the documentation is precise and informative, helping developers understand each member's role and functionality.

### Rationale behind

Enum types and their members serve different purposes in documentation.
The Enum type documentation describes what the overall enumeration represents, while each member documentation should explain what that specific value means.

When member documentation uses the same phrases as the type documentation, it creates confusion and adds no useful information.
For example, if an Enum "Defines the status" then a member should not also say it "Defines" something, it should describe what specific status it represents.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Member Meanings**:
  Distinct documentation for each member helps developers understand exactly what each value represents.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Avoiding repetition of the Enum type's documentation keeps member documentation focused and meaningful.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  Developers can quickly distinguish between different Enum members when each has clear, specific documentation.

- **Improved API Usability**:
  Clear documentation for each Enum member makes it easier to choose the right value for a specific situation.

- **More Professional Documentation**:
  Well-written, specific documentation for each member demonstrates attention to detail and care in API design.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the Enum member documentation to describe what the specific value represents rather than using generic phrases from the Enum type documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2082
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2082
```
