# MiKo_3232: Use null checks instead of empty property pattern

## Cause

Code uses an empty property pattern (`{ }`) to check for non-null values.

## Rule description

The empty property pattern only checks for non-nullness but implies structural matching, which can be misleading.
Null checks or declaration patterns are more idiomatic, improve readability, and reduce cognitive overhead.

### Rationale behind

The empty property pattern `{ }` suggests that properties are being matched, but it actually only checks if the value is not null.
This mismatch between appearance and behavior can confuse developers and make the code harder to understand.

Using explicit null checks instead of empty property patterns provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Explicit null checks clearly communicate that only nullness is being tested.
  There is no ambiguity about what the pattern is checking.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  The empty property pattern looks like it might be matching object structure.
  Explicit null checks eliminate this potential misunderstanding.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Null checks directly express the purpose of the condition.
  Developers immediately understand that the code is testing for null.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Using standard null-checking patterns aligns with common C# conventions.
  This makes the codebase more predictable and easier to navigate.

- **Lower Cognitive Load**:
  Explicit null checks require less mental effort to understand.
  Developers do not need to remember special pattern matching semantics.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Clear null checks are easier to modify and less likely to be misunderstood during maintenance.
  Future developers will quickly grasp the code's purpose.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the empty property pattern with an explicit null check.
Use standard null-checking syntax like `!= null`, `is not null`, or declaration patterns.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3232
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3232
```
