# MiKo_6052: Place colon of list of base types on same line as first base type

## Cause

The colon leading the list of base types is not on the same line as the first base type.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when the colons leading the list of base types are on the same line as the first base types.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Class and interface declarations often specify base types or implemented interfaces.
When the colon is separated from the first base type, it creates visual disconnection that makes the inheritance hierarchy harder to understand.

Placing the colon on the same line as the first base type provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The inheritance or interface implementation relationship is immediately clear when the colon and the first base type are together.
  Developers can see at a glance which types the class inherits from or implements.

- **Clearer Type Relationships**:
  Keeping the colon with the first base type makes it obvious that inheritance or interface implementation is occurring.
  This helps developers understand the type hierarchy and contracts that the class must fulfill.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Type declarations read naturally when the colon and the first base type are on the same line.
  This follows common C# conventions and makes the code more intuitive.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When the base type list starts on the same line as the colon, it can be processed more efficiently.
  Developers do not need to scan multiple lines to understand the class relationships.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  Compact base type declarations make it easier to scan through code and identify inheritance hierarchies.
  This is helpful when understanding class relationships and polymorphism.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify inheritance and interface implementation during code reviews when the declarations are compact.
  It is easier to check that the correct base types are specified.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the first base type to the same line as the colon.
Ensure that the type declaration is compact and reads naturally.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6052
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6052
```
