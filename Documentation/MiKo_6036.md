# MiKo_6036: Place lambda blocks directly below the corresponding arrow(s)

## Cause

Lambda blocks are not positioned directly below their corresponding arrows.

## Rule description

To easily distinguish lambda blocks from other code blocks, position them either in line with or directly below the corresponding arrow.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Lambda expressions are a common pattern in modern C# code, but when lambda blocks are not properly aligned with their arrows, they can become difficult to distinguish from surrounding code.
Inconsistent positioning makes it harder to identify where a lambda expression starts and ends.

Placing lambda blocks directly below their corresponding arrows provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Clarity**:
  When the block is aligned with its arrow, the relationship between the lambda parameters and the lambda body is immediately clear.
  This visual alignment helps developers quickly identify lambda expressions in the code.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Consistent positioning of lambda blocks creates a clear visual hierarchy.
  Developers can easily see the structure of the code and understand how different lambda expressions relate to each other.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When lambda blocks are properly aligned, it is easier to set breakpoints and step through the code during debugging.
  The clear visual structure helps developers understand the execution flow.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Lambda blocks that are aligned with their arrows are less likely to be confused with other code blocks such as method bodies or conditional statements.
  This clarity is especially important in complex code with nested lambdas.

- **Faster Code Comprehension**:
  Developers can quickly scan the code and identify lambda expressions when they follow a consistent positioning pattern.
  This reduces the time needed to understand what the code does.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, position the lambda block either on the same line as the arrow (for short expressions) or directly below the arrow with proper indentation.
Ensure that the opening brace of the lambda block is aligned with the arrow operator.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6036
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6036
```
