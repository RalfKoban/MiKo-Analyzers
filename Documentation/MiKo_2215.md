# MiKo_2215: Keep documentation sentences short

## Cause

A sentence in the documentation exceeds the recommended length of 15 words.

## Rule description

Keep documentation sentences up to 15 words.
Shorter sentences are clearer and more descriptive.
Longer sentences can be hard to read and may bore readers.
This approach ensures effective communication.

### Rationale behind

Long sentences are more difficult to parse and understand, especially when reading quickly in IntelliSense or scanning through documentation.
Cognitive research shows that shorter sentences are easier to process and remember.

When sentences become too long, they often try to convey multiple ideas at once, which can confuse readers.
Breaking long sentences into shorter ones improves clarity and makes each idea stand out more clearly.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Comprehension**:
  Short sentences are easier to understand and require less mental effort to process.

- **Better Scannability**:
  Developers can quickly scan and grasp information when sentences are concise.

- **Clearer Ideas**:
  Shorter sentences typically express one idea each, making documentation more focused.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Brief sentences require less working memory to understand, especially in complex technical content.

- **Faster Reading**:
  Developers can read and understand short sentences more quickly while working on code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, break long sentences into shorter ones.
Aim for sentences that express a single idea clearly and concisely.
