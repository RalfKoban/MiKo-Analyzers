# MiKo_3104: Apply NUnit's [Combinatorial] attribute properly

## Cause

A test method has the `[Combinatorial]` attribute applied but has fewer than two parameters.

## Rule description

Use NUnit's `[Combinatorial]` attribute only when a test method has at least two parameters for combinatorial testing.
If there is only one parameter, this attribute is unnecessary and adds no value.

### Rationale behind

The `[Combinatorial]` attribute in NUnit generates test cases by combining all possible values from multiple parameters.
When a test method has only one parameter, there is nothing to combine, making the attribute meaningless.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Removes Unnecessary Code**:
  Attributes that serve no purpose clutter the test code.
  Removing them makes the tests cleaner and easier to read.

- **Clarifies Test Intent**:
  The presence of `[Combinatorial]` suggests the test is combining multiple parameters.
  When used incorrectly, it misleads developers about what the test is actually doing.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  Developers seeing `[Combinatorial]` on a single-parameter test might wonder what combinations are being tested.
  Removing the attribute eliminates this confusion.

- **Improves Maintainability**:
  Keeping test attributes minimal and meaningful makes the test suite easier to maintain.
  Developers can focus on attributes that actually affect test behavior.

- **Follows Framework Conventions**:
  Using NUnit attributes correctly aligns with the framework's design and best practices.
  This makes the test code more intuitive for developers familiar with NUnit.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `[Combinatorial]` attribute from test methods that have fewer than two parameters.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3104
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3104
```
