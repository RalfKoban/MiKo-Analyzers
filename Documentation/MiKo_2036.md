# MiKo_2036: Describe default values in Boolean or Enum property documentation

## Cause

A Boolean or Enum property documentation does not describe the default return value.

## Rule description

Boolean or Enum property documentation should conclude with a phrase detailing the default return value.
This helps developers quickly understand the property's typical output.

### Rationale behind

Properties that return Boolean or Enum values often have default values that are important for developers to understand.
Documenting the default value helps developers know what to expect when the property has not been explicitly set or when an object is first created.

Including default value information in property documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Default Behavior**:
  Documenting the default value makes it immediately clear what the property returns when not explicitly set.
  Developers can understand the initial state of the property without having to inspect the constructor or implementation.

- **Better Decision Making**:
  When developers know the default value, they can make better decisions about whether they need to explicitly set the property.
  This reduces unnecessary code and improves clarity.

- **Reduced Assumptions**:
  Explicitly documenting default values eliminates the need for developers to make assumptions.
  This reduces errors and misunderstandings about property behavior.

- **Improved Testing**:
  Knowing the default value helps developers write better tests that verify the property behaves correctly in its initial state.
  This improves test coverage and code quality.

- **Consistent Documentation**:
  Including default value information creates a consistent documentation pattern across the codebase.
  This makes documentation more predictable and easier to read.

- **Better API Understanding**:
  When consuming an API, understanding default values is crucial for proper usage.
  Clear documentation of defaults improves the overall API experience.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a phrase at the end of the Boolean or Enum property documentation that describes the default return value.
Clearly state what value the property returns when not explicitly set.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2036
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2036
```
