# MiKo_2300: Explain the `Why` instead of the `How` in comments

## Cause

A comment describes how the code works instead of explaining why it is written that way.

## Rule description

Comments should provide the deeper reasons behind the code, explaining why it is written that way.
Avoid detailing how the code works—let the code itself do that.
This approach ensures comments are insightful and add real value by giving context and rationale, helping developers understand the reasoning behind the implementation.

### Rationale behind

Code shows how something is done, but it often cannot explain why certain decisions were made.
Comments that merely describe how the code works are redundant and waste space.
Comments should provide the context and reasoning that cannot be expressed in code alone.

Explaining why instead of how provides several important benefits:

- **Preserves Design Decisions**:
  Comments that explain why code exists preserve important context about design decisions.
  Future maintainers can understand the reasoning and avoid making changes that violate original intentions.

- **Prevents Redundancy**:
  Well-written code should be self-explanatory about how it works.
  Comments that repeat what the code does add no value and clutter the codebase.

- **Adds Real Value**:
  When comments explain why, they provide information that is not available anywhere else.
  This makes them genuinely useful rather than just noise.

- **Improves Maintainability**:
  Understanding why code exists helps maintainers decide whether to keep, modify, or remove it.
  Without this context, changes become risky and uncertain.

- **Documents Constraints**:
  Comments explaining why often reveal constraints, requirements, or edge cases that are not obvious from the code.
  This helps prevent bugs when code is modified.

- **Supports Better Refactoring**:
  When developers understand why code was written a certain way, they can refactor it while preserving the original intent.
  Without this understanding, refactoring can inadvertently break functionality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite comments to explain why the code exists or why it is written in a particular way, rather than describing how it works.
Focus on context, constraints, design decisions, and reasoning.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2300
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2300
```
