# MiKo_2239: Use `///` instead of `/** */` for documentation

## Cause

API documentation uses the `/** */` comment syntax instead of the XML documentation comment syntax `///`.

## Rule description

API documentation should use `///` instead of `/** */` because `///` creates XML comments that the .NET compiler understands.
These comments show up in IntelliSense, help generate external documentation, and follow a structured format.
`/** */` is just for general comments and will not be used by tools or IDEs to provide helpful information.

### Rationale behind

The .NET ecosystem has standardized on XML documentation comments using `///` syntax.
This format is recognized by compilers, IDEs, and documentation generation tools.
Using `/** */` instead means losing all these benefits.

Using `///` instead of `/** */` provides several important benefits:

- **IntelliSense Support**:
  Only `///` comments appear in IntelliSense tooltips when developers hover over methods or types.
  Comments using `/** */` are ignored by IntelliSense, making them invisible to API consumers.

- **Documentation Generation**:
  Tools like DocFX, Sandcastle, and others generate external documentation from XML comments.
  They cannot process `/** */` comments, meaning the documentation will not appear in generated docs.

- **Compiler Processing**:
  The C# compiler processes `///` comments and can generate XML documentation files during compilation.
  These files are used by IDEs and documentation tools.
  `/** */` comments are not processed by the compiler.

- **Structured Format**:
  XML documentation comments support structured tags like `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, and more.
  This allows for rich, organized documentation that tools can parse and present effectively.

- **Consistency with Ecosystem**:
  The entire .NET ecosystem uses `///` for API documentation.
  Using this standard format ensures code fits naturally into the broader ecosystem.

- **Better Tooling**:
  IDEs provide special support for XML documentation comments, including auto-completion for tags, validation, and formatting.
  This makes writing documentation easier and more reliable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `/** */` comment blocks with `///` XML documentation comments.
Convert the content into appropriate XML tags like `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2239
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2239
```
