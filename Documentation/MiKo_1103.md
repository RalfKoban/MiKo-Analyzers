# MiKo_1103: Name test initialization methods `PrepareTest`

## Cause

A test setup method is not named `PrepareTest`.

## Rule description

Test setup methods (marked with `[SetUp]` or similar attributes) should be consistently named `PrepareTest` to clearly indicate their purpose and improve readability.

### Rationale behind

Using a consistent name for test setup methods is important for test code readability and maintainability.

Naming all test setup methods `PrepareTest` provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  Developers can instantly recognize setup methods across all test classes without having to check attributes or read method bodies.
  This standardization reduces cognitive load when navigating test code.

- **Consistent Team Standards**:
  A uniform naming convention ensures all team members follow the same pattern, making code reviews easier and reducing debates about naming choices.

- **Clearer Purpose**:
  The name `PrepareTest` clearly communicates that this method sets up the conditions needed for each test to run.
  This is more explicit than generic names like `Setup` or `Initialize`.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all setup methods have the same name, it is easier to find and modify setup logic across multiple test classes.
  This consistency speeds up maintenance tasks.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  Many development tools can leverage consistent naming to provide better navigation features, making it easier to jump between related test infrastructure methods.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test setup method to `PrepareTest`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1103
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1103
