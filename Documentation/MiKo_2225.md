# MiKo_2225: Place code marked with `<c>` tags on single line

## Cause

XML documentation uses `<c>` tags for multi-line code instead of using `<code>` tags.

## Rule description

Use the `<c>` tag to mark text within a description as code, but only for single lines.
For multiple lines of code, the `<code>` tag should be used instead.
This ensures the formatting is clear and the documentation remains organized and readable.

### Rationale behind

The [`<c>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#c) and [`<code>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#code) tags serve different purposes in XML documentation, and using them correctly ensures proper rendering in IntelliSense and documentation tools.
Misusing these tags leads to poorly formatted documentation that confuses readers.

Using the correct tag for [single-line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#c) and [multi-line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#code) code provides several important benefits:

- **Proper Rendering**:
  Documentation tools and IntelliSense render `<c>` tags as inline code and `<code>` tags as code blocks.
  Using the wrong tag results in awkward formatting that is hard to read.

- **Clear Intent**:
  When developers use `<c>` for inline code and `<code>` for code blocks, it is immediately clear how the content should appear.
  This makes documentation easier to write and maintain.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  IDEs and documentation generators are optimized for the standard use of these tags.
  Following conventions ensures the best possible display in all contexts.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Inline code snippets flow naturally within sentences when properly marked with `<c>`.
  Multi-line code blocks stand out clearly when marked with `<code>`, making the documentation easier to scan.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  Following the standard usage patterns creates consistency across the entire codebase.
  Developers know what to expect and can focus on content rather than formatting.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Properly formatted documentation demonstrates attention to detail and commitment to quality, making the codebase more trustworthy.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use `<c>` tags only for single-line code snippets.
For multi-line code, replace `<c>` tags with `<code>` tags.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2225
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2225
```
