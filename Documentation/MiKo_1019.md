# MiKo_1019: Name `Clear` and `Remove` methods based on their number of parameters

## Cause

A method named `Remove` has no parameters, or a method named `Clear` has parameters.

## Rule description

Methods named `Remove` that have no parameters should be renamed to `Clear` to better reflect their function.
Conversely, methods named `Clear` that have parameters should be renamed to `Remove` to accurately describe their action.

This naming convention helps ensure clarity and consistency in method functionality:
- `Clear` removes all items
- `Remove` removes specific items

### Rationale behind

Following the `Clear` vs. `Remove` naming convention is crucial for creating predictable, intuitive APIs that align with .NET Framework standards.
This distinction is used consistently throughout the .NET Base Class Library (e.g., `List<T>.Clear()` removes all items, `List<T>.Remove(item)` removes a specific item).
When developers see `Clear`, they expect it to empty the entire collection without needing parameters.
When they see `Remove`, they expect to specify what to remove.

Violating this convention creates confusion and increases the likelihood of errors - calling the wrong method or passing unexpected parameters.
This pattern also makes API discovery more intuitive through IntelliSense: if a developer wants to remove everything, they look for `Clear`; if they want to remove something specific, they look for `Remove`.

Following this established pattern provides several important benefits:

- **Predictable API Behavior**:
  Developers immediately know `Clear` removes all items and `Remove` removes specific items.
  This predictability reduces errors and improves code correctness.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Base Class Library uses this pattern universally in collection types.
  Following it makes custom APIs feel integrated with platform standards.

- **Improved API Discovery**:
  IntelliSense users can easily find the right method based on their intent.
  - Need to remove everything? Look for `Clear`.
  - Remove something specific? Look for `Remove`.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  Developers familiar with .NET collections immediately understand custom collection-like APIs.
  No need to learn project-specific naming conventions.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Method names clearly indicate behavior without needing documentation.
  `Clear` means "remove all", `Remove` means "remove this specific item".

- **Better Code Portability**:
  When APIs follow standard conventions, code is easier to understand across projects and teams.
  Developers can apply their existing knowledge immediately.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename parameterless `Remove` methods to `Clear`, and rename `Clear` methods that take parameters to `Remove`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1019
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1019
