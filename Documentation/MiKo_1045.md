# MiKo_1045: Do not suffix command-invoked methods with `Command`

## Cause

A method invoked by a command ends with the suffix `Command`.

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance, drop the `Command` suffix since the method is already invoked as a command.
Keeps things clean and clear.

Methods that are invoked by commands should have action-oriented names without the `Command` suffix.
The fact that they are invoked by a command is clear from their usage context.

### Rationale behind

Methods that are invoked by commands are implementation details of the command pattern.
They represent the action that is executed when the command runs, not the command itself.
Adding a `Command` suffix to these methods creates confusion and makes the code harder to read.

Avoiding the `Command` suffix on command-invoked methods provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Distinction**:
  Command types should have the `Command` suffix, but the methods they invoke should not.
  This clear separation makes it easy to understand what is a command object and what is an action method.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Action-oriented method names like `Save` or `Delete` are clearer than `SaveCommand` or `DeleteCommand`.
  The method name describes what action it performs, not how it is invoked.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  When a command named `SaveCommand` invokes a method, calling that method `SaveCommand` as well is redundant.
  The method should simply be named `Save` or a more specific action name.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Methods without the `Command` suffix can be reused in contexts other than commands.
  This makes the code more flexible and modular.

- **Consistency with .NET Patterns**:
  The .NET Framework and MVVM patterns use action-oriented names for command handler methods.
  Following this convention keeps the code consistent with established practices.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  A method named `Save` clearly indicates it performs the save action.
  A method named `SaveCommand` suggests it might execute another command, which is confusing.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Command` suffix from the method name.
Use an action-oriented name that describes what the method does.

For example, rename `SaveCommand` to `Save`, or `DeleteCommand` to `Delete`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1045
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1045
```
