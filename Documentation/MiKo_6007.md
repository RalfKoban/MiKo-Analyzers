# MiKo_6007: Surround test statements with blank lines

## Cause

Test statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround test statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding test statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear test structure and organization.
Test statements often represent the action phase in unit tests or specific test operations, and visually separating them helps developers understand the test flow and distinguish between different phases of test execution.

Surrounding test statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Test Phase Visibility**:
  Blank lines make test statements stand out as distinct operations within the test.
  This helps developers identify the action phase and understand what is being tested.

- **Improved Test Readability**:
  When test statements are visually separated, tests are easier to read and comprehend.
  The blank lines create natural breaks that guide the reader through the test logic.

- **Better Test Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize tests into logical sections.
  Test statements are clearly distinguished from setup code and assertions.

- **Easier Test Debugging**:
  Visually distinct test statements are easier to locate when debugging failing tests.
  Developers can quickly identify the action being tested without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  During code reviews, separated test statements make it easier to verify test logic.
  Reviewers can quickly understand what actions are being performed in the test.

- **Better Test Maintainability**:
  When test statements are clearly separated, modifying or extending tests is simpler.
  The visual structure makes it obvious where test operations occur.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after test statements.
Ensure each test statement or group of related test statements is visually separated from surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6007
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6007
```
