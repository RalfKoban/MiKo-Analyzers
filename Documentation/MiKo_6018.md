# MiKo_6018: Surround break statements with blank lines

## Cause

`break` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `break` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `break` statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear control flow visibility.
Break statements represent exit points from loops or switch cases, and visually separating them helps developers understand where control flow interruptions occur, making the logic easier to follow and reducing the risk of overlooking these important control flow changes.

Surrounding break statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Control Flow Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `break` statements stand out as control flow exit points.
  Developers can immediately identify where loops or switch cases are exited.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When break statements are visually separated, the control flow is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that execution will jump out of the current block.

- **Better Code Structure Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the relationship between the preceding logic and the exit point.
  This makes it clear when and why the loop or case is terminated.

- **Reduced Oversight Risk**:
  Visually distinct break statements are harder to overlook during code reading or review.
  This reduces the risk of misunderstanding the control flow.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated break statements are easier to locate when debugging.
  Developers can quickly find exit points to verify that loops or cases terminate correctly.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When break statements are clearly separated, modifying control flow is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where execution exits the current block.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `break` statements.
Ensure each break statement is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6018
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6018
```
