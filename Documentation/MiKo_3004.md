# MiKo_3004: Make `EventArgs` property setters private

## Cause

An `EventArgs` class has properties with public setters.

## Rule description

EventArgs are meant solely for raising events and passing data to event handlers.
If the event data changes between handlers, it leads to unpredictable behavior and potential race conditions.

To prevent this, make `EventArgs` properties read-only or only privately settable.
If setting the event data is needed, provide a method that acts as a circuit breaker, allowing the data to be set only once.
This approach ensures consistent and reliable behavior.

### Rationale behind

EventArgs with mutable public properties create unpredictable and hard-to-debug scenarios.
When multiple event handlers can modify the same event arguments, the behavior becomes dependent on handler execution order, leading to race conditions and inconsistent state.

Making `EventArgs` properties immutable provides several important benefits:

- **Predictable Behavior**:
  When event data cannot be modified by handlers, all handlers receive the same information.
  This eliminates ordering dependencies and makes the event flow predictable.

- **Thread Safety**:
  Immutable event arguments are inherently thread-safe.
  Multiple handlers can process events concurrently without synchronization concerns.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When event data cannot change, debugging is simpler.
  Developers can inspect the event arguments knowing they remain constant throughout the event chain.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Read-only properties communicate that event arguments are meant for information passing only.
  This makes the API design and usage expectations clear.

- **Prevents Side Effects**:
  When handlers cannot modify event arguments, they cannot inadvertently affect other handlers.
  This isolation makes each handler more reliable and testable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the property setters to private or remove them entirely.
Initialize the properties through the constructor instead.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3004
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3004
```
