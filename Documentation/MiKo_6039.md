# MiKo_6039: Place return values on same line(s) as return keywords

## Cause

Return values are placed on different lines than their return keywords.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when return keywords and return values are placed on the same lines.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Return statements are critical points in code where control flow exits a method and a value is returned to the caller.
When the return keyword and the value being returned are on different lines, it becomes harder to understand what the method is returning.

Placing return values on the same lines as return keywords provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete return statement is visible at a glance, making it immediately clear what value is being returned.
  Developers do not need to scan multiple lines to understand the method's output.

- **Clearer Method Behavior**:
  Return statements are often critical to understanding what a method does.
  Keeping them compact makes it easier to identify all return points in a method and understand the different values that can be returned.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When a return statement fits on one line, developers can process it as a single unit of information.
  This reduces the mental effort needed to understand what the method returns and when.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Compact return statements are easier to review during code reviews.
  Reviewers can quickly verify that the correct value is being returned without having to reconstruct the statement from multiple lines.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  When searching for return statements or specific return values, having them on single lines makes them easier to locate.
  Developers can quickly scan through a method to find all exit points.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Return statements read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows the expected pattern and makes the code more intuitive to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the return value to the same line as the return keyword.
Ensure that the complete return statement is on a single line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6039
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6039
```
