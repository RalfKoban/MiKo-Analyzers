# MiKo_1510: Do not suffix fields with pattern names

## Cause

A field name is suffixed with a pattern name.

## Rule description

Prefer naming fields using prefixes to describe their role rather than suffixes to describe their type.
This improves code readability, avoids confusion with class names and helps developers quickly understand the purpose of the field in context.

Using descriptive names based on purpose rather than type makes code more maintainable and easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Fields represent the state and dependencies of a class.
Their names should communicate what they store and how they are used in the business logic, not the technical patterns used in their implementation.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Better Class Understanding**:
  When reading a class, developers should quickly understand its responsibilities and dependencies.
  Fields like `_loggerFactory` or `_validatorStrategy` force developers to think about implementation details rather than business purpose.
  Fields like `_logger` or `_validator` communicate purpose directly.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  If you have a field of type `IPaymentStrategyFactory`, naming it `_paymentStrategyFactory` is redundant.
  The type already tells you it is a factory.
  Naming it `_paymentProvider` or `_paymentSource` adds semantic value.

- **Cleaner Code Reading**:
  Code like `_validatorStrategy.Validate(order)` reads less naturally than `_validator.Validate(order)`. 
  The pattern suffix adds cognitive noise without improving understanding.

- **Better Encapsulation**:
  Field names should not expose implementation details to anyone reading the class.
  Role-based names maintain encapsulation by focusing on what the field does, not how it is implemented.

- **Easier Pattern Changes**:
  If you refactor from using a Strategy pattern to a different approach, role-based field names remain valid.
  Pattern-based names would require renaming throughout the class.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field to use a prefix that describes its role instead of a suffix that describes its type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1510
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1510
```
