# MiKo_1039: Use default name for `this` parameter of extension methods

## Cause

The `this` parameter of an extension method does not use a standard name.

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance, the `this` parameter in extension methods should always have a standard name.
This makes the code consistent and easier to understand.

Using a consistent naming pattern helps developers quickly identify extension methods and understand which type is being extended.

### Rationale behind

Extension methods extend existing types by adding new functionality.
The first parameter (marked with the `this` keyword) represents the instance being extended, and using a consistent naming convention for this parameter improves code readability and maintainability.

When extension method parameters follow a predictable naming pattern, developers can more easily understand the code and recognize extension methods at a glance.
Consistency in naming reduces cognitive load and makes the codebase more professional and easier to work with.

Using a standard name for the `this` parameter provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Consistent parameter names make extension methods easier to scan and understand.
  Developers do not need to interpret different naming choices in each method.

- **Clear Intent**:
  Standard parameter names immediately signal that a method is an extension method.
  The consistency helps developers recognize the pattern.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all extension methods follow the same naming convention, it is easier to review, refactor, and update them.
  The predictable pattern reduces the mental effort needed to work with the code.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  Consistent naming makes it easier to search for and locate extension methods in the codebase.
  Developers can quickly find all extensions for a specific type.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Following consistent naming conventions signals well-maintained, thoughtfully organized code.
  It demonstrates attention to detail and coding standards.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When parameter names are consistent, developers do not need to remember different naming choices across different methods.
  This frees mental energy for understanding the actual logic.

- **Team Alignment**:
  A standard naming convention ensures all team members follow the same pattern, creating a cohesive codebase rather than a patchwork of individual preferences.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `this` parameter of the extension method to use a standard name that is consistent across the codebase.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1039
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1039
```
