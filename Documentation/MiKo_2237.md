# MiKo_2237: Do not separate documentation with empty lines

## Cause

XML documentation contains empty lines that break the continuity of the documentation block.

## Rule description

XML documentation helps organize code and allows tools like Sandcastle or IntelliSense to create useful references.
Empty lines in XML comments can confuse these tools, leading to errors or problems.
Keeping comments compact and continuous makes them easier to read and ensures documentation stays clear and reliable for both developers and tools.

### Rationale behind

Empty lines within XML documentation serve no useful purpose and can cause problems with documentation tools.
Most documentation renderers ignore or mishandle empty lines, leading to unexpected formatting or processing errors.

Removing empty lines from XML documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Better Tool Compatibility**:
  Documentation generation tools and IntelliSense are designed to work with continuous XML comment blocks.
  Empty lines can confuse parsers and lead to rendering errors or warnings.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Continuous documentation blocks are easier to scan and read as a cohesive unit.
  Empty lines create visual breaks that fragment the documentation unnecessarily.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  Following the standard practice of continuous XML comments creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes documentation more predictable and easier to maintain.

- **Prevents Parsing Issues**:
  Some documentation tools may treat empty lines as the end of a documentation block.
  This can cause parts of the documentation to be lost or incorrectly processed.

- **Cleaner Code**:
  Removing unnecessary empty lines makes code files more compact and easier to navigate.
  Less vertical space is wasted on non-functional elements.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Well-formatted, continuous documentation demonstrates attention to detail and understanding of XML documentation conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove empty lines from within XML documentation comment blocks.
Keep all documentation continuous without breaks.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2237
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2237
```
