# MiKo_1048: End value converter classes with a specific suffix

## Cause

A value converter class does not end with the suffix `Converter`.

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance, all class names for value converters should end with the suffix `Converter`.
This consistency helps quickly identify their role and purpose.

Value converters are used to convert values between different types, typically in UI frameworks like WPF.
Using a consistent suffix makes it easy to find and recognize all value converter classes in the codebase.

### Rationale behind

Value converters are a specific pattern used in UI frameworks to transform data for display or binding purposes.
Using a consistent naming convention makes these special-purpose classes immediately recognizable.

Suffixing value converter classes with `Converter` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers can easily find all converter classes by searching for classes ending with `Converter`.
  This makes navigating the codebase much faster when looking for existing converters.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `Converter` suffix immediately tells developers that this class transforms values.
  There is no ambiguity about the purpose or role of the class.

- **Consistency with Framework Conventions**:
  UI frameworks like WPF use the `Converter` suffix for built-in converters like `BooleanToVisibilityConverter`.
  Following this convention makes custom converters feel like natural extensions of the framework.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  When all converters follow the same naming convention, they naturally group together in file explorers and code navigation tools.
  This makes the project structure clearer.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to guess whether a class is a converter or some other kind of object.
  The name makes its purpose explicit.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly identify converter classes and verify they follow the correct patterns and interfaces.
  This speeds up the review process.

- **Better Reusability**:
  Well-named converters are easier to discover and reuse across different parts of the application.
  This reduces code duplication.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the value converter class to end with the `Converter` suffix.

For example, rename `BooleanToVisibility` to `BooleanToVisibilityConverter`, or `StringFormatter` to `StringFormatterConverter`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1048
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1048
```
