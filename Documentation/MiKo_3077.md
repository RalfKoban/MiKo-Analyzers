# MiKo_3077: Provide default values for Enum-returning properties

## Cause

A property that returns an `Enum` type does not explicitly set a default value.

## Rule description

Explicitly setting values for properties that return an `Enum` helps easily identify the default value and any changes.
This practice aids in ensuring the value is the intended one, keeping the code clear and helping to spot unintended changes quickly.

### Rationale behind

When properties return enum values, explicitly initializing them makes the code's intent clear and prevents subtle bugs that can occur when default values are not what developers expect.
Without explicit initialization, properties get default values that might not match the intended behavior.

Explicitly setting default values for enum-returning properties provides several important benefits:

- **Makes Intent Clear**:
  When a property is explicitly initialized, it is immediately obvious what the default value should be.
  This eliminates guesswork and makes the code self-documenting.

- **Prevents Unexpected Defaults**:
  Without explicit initialization, enum properties default to the first enum value (zero).
  This might not be the intended default, especially if the enum values are not designed with zero as a meaningful default.

- **Simplifies Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that the default value is correct when it is explicitly set.
  Implicit defaults require reviewers to understand enum definition and default value rules.

- **Detects Enum Changes Early**:
  When enum definitions change, explicitly initialized properties will show compiler errors if the initialization is no longer valid.
  This helps catch breaking changes immediately rather than discovering them at runtime.

- **Improves Maintainability**:
  Future developers can understand the intended default behavior without having to look up the enum definition.
  This reduces cognitive load when reading and maintaining the code.

- **Supports Validation Logic**:
  When defaults are explicit, it becomes easier to write validation or initialization logic that depends on knowing what the default state should be.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, explicitly initialize the property with the appropriate enum value in the property declaration or in the constructor.
Choose the enum value that represents the correct default state for the property based on the business logic and requirements.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3077
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3077
```
