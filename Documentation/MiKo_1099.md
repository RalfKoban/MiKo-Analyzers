# MiKo_1099: Use identical names for matching parameters on method overloads

## Cause

Method overloads have parameters at the same position with different names.

## Rule description

Parameters on method overloads should have the same name.
The reason is that most likely these parameters represent the same inputs across the different overloads which should be reflected in their names.

### Rationale behind

When method overloads use different parameter names for the same positional parameters, it creates confusion about whether the parameters serve the same purpose.
Developers looking at different overloads need to mentally verify that parameters in the same position represent the same concept, even though the names suggest they might be different.
This inconsistency makes code harder to understand and increases the risk of using methods incorrectly.

Using identical parameter names across overloads provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Consistent parameter names make it immediately clear that parameters in the same position represent the same concept across all overloads.
  Developers do not need to guess or verify whether different names mean different things.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  When parameter names are consistent across overloads, IDE features like IntelliSense show a coherent set of parameter names.
  This makes it easier to understand what parameters are needed and reduces confusion when switching between overloads.

- **Enhanced Named Arguments Support**:
  When using named arguments in C#, consistent parameter names across overloads allow developers to use the same argument names regardless of which overload they call.
  This makes code more maintainable when switching between overloads.

- **Better Code Readability**:
  Code that uses method overloads is easier to read when parameter names are consistent.
  Developers can focus on understanding the differences between overloads (like additional optional parameters) rather than being distracted by name variations.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Consistent naming reduces the mental effort required to understand method signatures.
  Developers do not need to remember multiple names for the same concept across different overloads.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  When parameter names are consistent, refactoring operations like extracting common logic or reorganizing overloads become simpler.
  There is no need to reconcile different parameter names that represent the same thing.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameters in the overloads to match each other.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1099
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1099
```
