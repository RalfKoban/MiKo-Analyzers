# MiKo_1011: Do not include `Do` in method names

## Cause

A method name includes `Do` as a prefix or verb.

## Rule description

Methods are meant to run code, so adding words like `Do` to their names is unnecessary and repetitive.
It is like saying `doDo` - it does not add any useful information.

The fact that a method performs an action is implicit in it being a method.
Including `Do` in the name adds redundancy without improving clarity.

Use descriptive verb names that explain what the method actually does rather than just stating that it does something.

### Rationale behind

Including `Do` in method names is a common anti-pattern that adds no semantic value while making names longer and less expressive.
Methods are inherently action-oriented, so prefixing them with `Do` is tautological - it is like saying "method that does something."

Instead, method names should use specific, meaningful verbs that clearly communicate the action being performed (e.g., `Calculate`, `Save`, `Validate`, `Transform`).
This specificity makes code self-documenting and improves readability.

When the `Do` prefix is eliminated and precise verbs are used, method calls read more naturally and convey intent more clearly.
For example, `CalculateTotal()` is immediately understandable, while `DoCalculation()` is vague and adds an unnecessary word.

Removing this redundancy provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Specific action verbs create self-documenting code.
  Developers immediately understand what each method does without reading implementation details.

- **Natural Method Calls**:
  Method calls read like natural language commands.
  `CalculateTotal()` flows better than `DoCalculation()`, making code easier to comprehend.

- **Meaningful Names**:
  Precise verbs convey the actual operation being performed.
  This eliminates ambiguity and makes APIs more intuitive.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Removing generic prefixes creates a more polished codebase.
  It signals attention to naming and API design.

- **Better API Design**:
  Specific action names encourage developers to think carefully about method purpose.
  This leads to better-designed, more focused methods.

- **Easier Code Maintenance**:
  When method names precisely describe their actions, finding and modifying code becomes simpler.
  Developers can locate the right method faster.

- **Clean Code Alignment**:
  Eliminating redundant prefixes aligns with clean code principles.
  It creates a professional, well-designed codebase that other developers respect.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to use a specific action verb instead of `Do`.
