# MiKo_4002: Place methods with same name and accessibility side-by-side

## Cause

Methods with the same name and accessibility are not placed side-by-side.

## Rule description

Place methods with the same name and accessibility side-by-side.
This keeps them grouped together, making the code easier to find, understand, and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Grouping methods with the same name and accessibility together creates a logical organization that significantly improves code navigation and comprehension.

When related methods are scattered throughout a class, developers waste time searching for all variations of a method, which disrupts their workflow and makes the code harder to work with.

Placing methods with the same name and accessibility side-by-side provides several important benefits:

- **Faster Navigation**:
  When all related methods are in one place, developers can quickly find and review all variations without scrolling through the entire file.
  This saves time and reduces frustration.

- **Easier Comparison**:
  Having methods side-by-side makes it easy to compare their implementations and understand how they differ.
  This is particularly helpful when choosing which method to call or when maintaining the methods.

- **Better Understanding of API Surface**:
  Grouping methods by name and accessibility reveals the complete public, protected, or private API at a glance.
  Developers can immediately see all available options for a particular operation.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  When updating or refactoring a method, having all related methods nearby makes it easier to ensure consistency across all variations.
  Changes that affect multiple overloads are less likely to be missed.

- **Reduced Code Navigation**:
  Developers do not need to jump around the file to understand how a particular method works in different contexts.
  All the information is in one logical location.

- **Clearer Code Structure**:
  Consistent grouping creates a predictable structure that makes the entire class easier to understand.
  Developers can quickly learn where to look for specific functionality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the methods so that all methods with the same name and accessibility level are placed directly next to each other.

Keep the methods grouped together without other members in between.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4002
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4002
```
