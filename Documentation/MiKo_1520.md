# MiKo_1520: Do not prefix or suffix local variables with `toCopy`

## Cause

A local variable name contains `toCopy` as a prefix or suffix.

## Rule description

Use `original` (or 'source`) as a variable name when providing an object to be copied, because it clearly indicates that it's the source of the data.
Avoid names like `toCopy`, which can be misleading and suggest it's the target instead.
Clear and conventional naming improves readability and reduces confusion.

Using standard, descriptive names helps developers immediately understand the purpose and role of variables.

## Rationale

The phrase `to copy` is ambiguous about direction.
It could mean `the object to be copied from` or `the object to copy to`, creating confusion about data flow and leading to potential bugs.

Using `original` (or 'source`) instead provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Data Flow Direction**:
  `original` (or 'source`) unambiguously indicate the source of data in a copy operation.
  `var copy = original.Clone()` makes the direction of data flow immediately obvious.
  `var copy = toCopy.Clone()` leaves doubt about which is source and which is destination.

- **Established Convention**:
  The term `original` (or 'source`) is widely used in programming to indicate the source object in copy operations.
  Following this convention makes code familiar and reduces the learning curve for new team members.

- **Reduced Logic Errors**:
  When variable names clearly indicate their role in an operation, developers are less likely to accidentally swap source and destination, preventing subtle bugs.

- **Better Code Reading**:
  Code like `var backup = original.Clone()` reads naturally and clearly communicates intent.
  `var backup = toCopy.Clone()` requires mental processing to understand the relationship.

- **Consistency with Design Patterns**:
  Many design patterns like Prototype use terminology like `original` (or 'source`) for the source object.
  Using consistent terminology across your codebase improves understanding.

- **Clearer Debugging**:
  When debugging copy operations, having variables clearly named as `original` (or 'source`) and `copy` makes it easy to track data flow and identify where issues occur.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the local variable to use `original` (or 'source`) instead of `toCopy`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1520
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1520
