# MiKo_2224: Place XML tags and texts on separate lines in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation has tags and text content on the same line instead of placing them on separate lines.

## Rule description

To improve usability and readability, place XML tags and their corresponding texts on separate lines in documentation.
This formatting makes it easier for developers to read and navigate the documentation, ensuring clarity and better organization.

### Rationale behind

Mixing XML tags and content on the same line creates visual clutter and makes documentation harder to scan and maintain.
Separating tags and content follows consistent formatting conventions that improve the overall documentation quality.

Placing XML tags and text on separate lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  When tags and content are on separate lines, the structure of the documentation becomes immediately clear.
  Developers can quickly identify what content belongs to which tag.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Updating documentation content is simpler when text is not mixed with XML tags on the same line.
  Developers can focus on the content without worrying about accidentally breaking tag syntax.

- **Better Version Control**:
  When documentation changes appear in version control diffs, having tags and content on separate lines makes it clearer what content changed.
  This improves code review quality.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  Following a standard format for XML documentation makes the codebase more professional and easier to navigate.
  Developers know what to expect and can work more efficiently.

- **Reduced Syntax Errors**:
  Separating tags and content reduces the chance of accidentally introducing syntax errors when editing documentation.
  It is easier to see if tags are properly opened and closed.

- **Enhanced Tool Support**:
  Many documentation tools and formatters work better with properly structured XML where tags and content are clearly separated.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place XML tags and their text content on separate lines in the documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2224
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2224
```
