# MiKo_1108: Do not name variables, parameters, fields and properties `Mock`, `Stub`, `Fake` or `Shim`

## Cause

A variable, parameter, field, or property contains `Mock`, `Stub`, `Fake`, or `Shim` in its name.

## Rule description

Using technical test doubles terminology like `Mock`, `Stub`, `Fake`, or `Shim` in names exposes implementation details.
Instead, use domain-specific names that describe what the item represents.

### Rationale behind

Avoiding test doubles terminology in names is important for test clarity and maintainability.

Using domain-specific names instead of technical test terminology provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Test code that uses domain names like `userRepository` instead of `userRepositoryMock` reads more naturally and focuses on what the object represents rather than how it is implemented.
  This makes tests easier to understand.

- **Reduced Implementation Coupling**:
  Names that do not reference mocking frameworks or testing techniques remain valid even if the test implementation changes.
  This makes refactoring safer and less disruptive.

- **Better Test Intent**:
  Domain-focused names help tests communicate what business scenario they are validating rather than drawing attention to testing infrastructure.
  This keeps tests focused on behavior rather than mechanics.

- **Clearer Production Code Alignment**:
  When test code uses the same names as production code (without `Mock` or `Stub` suffixes), it is easier to see how tests correspond to real usage scenarios.

- **Simplified Test Code**:
  Removing unnecessary suffixes makes test code more concise and reduces visual noise, allowing developers to focus on the important aspects of the test.

- **Framework Independence**:
  Tests that do not advertise which mocking framework or technique they use are easier to adapt if the team decides to switch testing tools.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the item to reflect its domain purpose, not its test infrastructure role.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1108
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1108
```
