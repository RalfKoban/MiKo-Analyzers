# MiKo_5002: Use `xxxFormat` methods only with multiple arguments

## Cause

A formatting method (like `DebugFormat`) is called with a string that has no format placeholders.

## Rule description

To improve performance, use `xxxFormat` methods (like `DebugFormat`) only with arguments for formatting the string.
Otherwise, use the non-formatting methods (like `Debug`).
This approach avoids unnecessary overhead and keeps the code efficient.

### Rationale behind

Formatting methods like `DebugFormat` are designed to format strings with placeholders and arguments.
When called with a plain string that has no placeholders, they perform unnecessary work checking for format items and processing arguments.

Using the appropriate method based on whether formatting is needed provides important benefits:

- **Avoided Unnecessary Processing**:
  Format methods need to scan the string for placeholders like `{0}` and `{1}`.
  When no placeholders exist, this scanning is wasted effort that the non-formatting methods skip entirely.

- **Better Performance**:
  Non-formatting methods are optimized for simple string output.
  They execute faster because they do not need to parse format strings or process argument arrays.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Using the correct method makes the code more readable.
  When developers see a `Format` method, they expect formatting to occur.
  Using the simple method when no formatting is needed makes the code easier to understand.

- **Reduced Memory Allocation**:
  Format methods may allocate additional memory to process arguments and build the final string.
  Simple methods can pass the string directly to the logging framework without extra allocations.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the formatting method with the non-formatting equivalent when no format placeholders are present.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5002
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5002
```
