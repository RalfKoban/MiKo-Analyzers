# MiKo_6057: Align type parameter constraint clauses vertically

## Cause

Type parameter constraint clauses are not aligned vertically.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when type parameter constraint clauses are aligned vertically.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Vertical alignment of type parameter constraint clauses is important for maintaining clean and professional-looking code.
When constraint clauses are aligned properly, the code structure becomes immediately visible, making it easier to understand the relationships between different generic type constraints.

Aligning type parameter constraint clauses vertically provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Scanability**:
  Vertically aligned constraints allow developers to quickly scan through multiple constraints without having to search for where each clause begins.
  The consistent alignment creates a visual pattern that the eye can follow easily.

- **Better Readability**:
  When constraints are aligned, it is easier to read and compare different constraints at a glance.
  This helps developers understand the requirements for each type parameter without having to mentally parse inconsistent formatting.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Consistent alignment reduces the mental effort required to understand the code structure.
  Developers do not need to spend time deciphering the layout, allowing them to focus on the actual constraints and their meaning.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Well-aligned code looks more professional and indicates that care has been taken in writing and maintaining the codebase.
  This creates a positive impression and encourages other developers to maintain the same standards.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  During code reviews, aligned constraints make it much easier to spot differences, errors, or missing constraints.
  Reviewers can quickly identify issues without having to reformat the code mentally.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When adding or modifying constraints in the future, aligned clauses make it easier to see where changes need to be made.
  This reduces the likelihood of introducing formatting inconsistencies or missing important constraints.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, align the type parameter constraint clauses vertically.
Ensure that each `where` keyword starts at the same column position, creating a clean vertical alignment.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6057
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6057
```
