# MiKo_1101: End test class names with `Tests`

## Cause

A test class name does not end with `Tests`.

## Rule description

A unit test class should use the suffix `Tests` rather than `Test`, since it typically contains multiple tests.

### Rationale behind

Using the plural `Tests` suffix is important for consistency and clarity in test code organization.

Using `Tests` instead of `Test` provides several important benefits:

- **Grammatical Correctness**:
  A test class contains multiple test methods, so the plural form `Tests` is grammatically correct and more natural.
  This makes the code easier to read and understand.

- **Consistency with Community Standards**:
  The `Tests` suffix is the widely adopted convention in the .NET testing community.
  Following this standard makes the codebase familiar to developers joining the project.

- **Clearer Distinction from Production Code**:
  The plural form helps distinguish test classes from production classes, making it easier to identify test code at a glance.

- **Better Alignment with Testing Frameworks**:
  Most popular .NET testing frameworks and examples use the `Tests` suffix, which means following this convention aligns with established best practices and documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the test class name to end with `Tests` instead of `Test`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1101
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1101
```
