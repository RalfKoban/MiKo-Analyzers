# MiKo_2015: Use `raise` or `throw` instead of `fire` in documentation

## Cause

Documentation uses the word `fire` when referring to events or exceptions.

## Rule description

The word `Fire` has negative connotations, like firing employees or guns.
It is not appropriate for events or exceptions.
Instead, use `Raise` for events and `Throw` for exceptions, as it conveys a more neutral and accurate action.

### Rationale behind

The word `fire` carries negative associations that are not appropriate in professional technical documentation.
Using precise, standard terminology improves clarity and maintains a professional tone.

Using appropriate terminology provides several important benefits:

- **Professional Tone**:
  Words like `raise` and `throw` are standard technical terms in .NET that sound professional and neutral.
  The word `fire` has negative connotations that make documentation sound unprofessional.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework documentation consistently uses `raise` for events and `throw` for exceptions.
  Following the same terminology creates consistency with official documentation.

- **Clear Communication**:
  `Raise` and `throw` are precise technical terms with well-defined meanings in .NET.
  They clearly communicate the specific action being performed without ambiguity.

- **Avoids Negative Associations**:
  The word `fire` evokes images of termination or violence that are not appropriate in technical documentation.
  Using neutral terms keeps the focus on the technical content.

- **International Understanding**:
  Standard technical terms like `raise` and `throw` are widely understood in the international development community.
  Colloquial terms like `fire` may be less clear to non-native English speakers.

- **Established Conventions**:
  The .NET community has established conventions for terminology.
  Following these conventions makes documentation more accessible to all developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the word `fire` with the appropriate term.

Use `raise` when referring to events and `throw` when referring to exceptions.
