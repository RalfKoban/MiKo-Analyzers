# MiKo_1069: Make property names reflect their meaning, not their type

## Cause

A property name is based on its type instead of its meaning.

## Rule description

To ease maintenance, property names should be based on the property's meaning rather than its type.

### Rationale behind

Property names that describe type rather than meaning create confusion and make code harder to understand.
When property names reflect what they represent, the code becomes self-documenting and much easier to work with.
Type information is already available through IntelliSense and type annotations, so repeating it in the name is redundant.

Using meaningful property names provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Intent**:
  Property names that describe meaning immediately tell developers what the property represents.
  There is no need to infer purpose from surrounding code.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Good property names reduce the need for comments explaining what each property stores.
  The property declaration itself becomes documentation.

- **Better Refactoring**:
  When property types change, meaningful names remain valid.
  Type-based names become misleading and require renaming when types evolve.

- **Improved IntelliSense**:
  When working with objects, IntelliSense shows property names.
  Meaningful names help developers find the right property without checking documentation.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can understand what a class does more quickly when properties have descriptive names.
  This leads to faster, more effective reviews.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Type information is already visible in the property declaration.
  Repeating it in the name adds clutter without adding value.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Code with meaningful property names appears more polished and well-designed.
  It demonstrates thoughtfulness about code quality and maintainability.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the property to reflect what it represents, not what type it is.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1069
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1069
```
