# MiKo_2230: Use `<list>` for return values with specific meanings in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation describes return values with specific meanings using plain text instead of a `<list>` tag.

## Rule description

When return values with specific meanings are documented via "Value Meaning", that documentation should be part of a `<list>`.
This makes it easier to read because the XML documentation renderer will place the contents in a list.
In contrast, when the documentation is just plain text, that is very difficult to read and understand because all text is placed behind each other in a single paragraph.

### Rationale behind

Return value documentation that lists multiple possible values and their meanings becomes unreadable when formatted as plain text.
Without proper structure, developers must carefully parse through dense paragraphs to find the information they need.

Using `<list>` for return values with specific meanings provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Lists present information in a scannable format where each item stands out clearly.
  Developers can quickly find the return value they are interested in without reading through paragraphs.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When documentation uses proper `<list>` tags, IntelliSense renders the content with appropriate formatting.
  This makes tooltips much easier to read and understand.

- **Clearer Structure**:
  Lists provide visual structure that helps organize information logically.
  Each return value and its meaning are clearly separated and easy to identify.

- **Enhanced Tool Support**:
  Documentation generation tools can properly format lists with tables or bullet points.
  Plain text paragraphs are rendered as dense blocks that are hard to navigate.

- **Faster Information Retrieval**:
  When developers need to know what a specific return value means, they can scan a list much faster than reading through prose.
  This improves productivity.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Well-formatted documentation with proper use of lists demonstrates care and attention to quality.
  It makes the codebase appear more polished and trustworthy.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, convert plain text documentation of return values and their meanings into a properly formatted `<list>` tag.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2230
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2230
```
