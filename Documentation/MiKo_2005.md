# MiKo_2005: Document textual references to `EventArgs` properly

## Cause

Documentation uses the term `event arg` instead of a proper reference to the specific `EventArgs` class.

## Rule description

Documentation should avoid using `event arg`.
Instead, directly reference the specific class like this: `<see cref="XyzEventArgs" />`.
This approach provides clarity and allows easy navigation to the related event argument type.

### Rationale behind

Using vague terms like `event arg` in documentation creates ambiguity and prevents developers from quickly accessing the information they need.
Proper type references using the `see cref` tag provide precise links to the actual classes being discussed.

Using proper type references provides several important benefits:

- **Direct Navigation**:
  The `see cref` tag creates a clickable link to the `EventArgs` class definition.
  Developers can immediately jump to the class to see what data it contains without searching through the codebase.

- **Type Safety**:
  The compiler verifies that referenced types actually exist.
  If an `EventArgs` class is renamed or removed, the documentation reference will generate a compiler warning, preventing outdated documentation.

- **IntelliSense Integration**:
  Proper type references display as formatted links in IntelliSense tooltips.
  This makes the documentation more interactive and easier to navigate while coding.

- **Precise Communication**:
  Referencing the specific `EventArgs` type removes any ambiguity about which class is being discussed.
  Developers know exactly what to look for rather than guessing which `event arg` is meant.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Properly formatted type references demonstrate attention to documentation quality.
  This makes the codebase appear more polished and well-maintained.

- **Better Search Results**:
  Documentation tools and search features can index and link type references properly.
  This makes it easier to find all places where a specific `EventArgs` class is mentioned.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace textual references to `event arg` with proper XML documentation references.

Use the `<see cref="SpecificEventArgs" />` syntax to create a typed reference to the actual `EventArgs` class.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2005
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2005
```
