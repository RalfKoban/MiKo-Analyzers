# MiKo_2202: Use term `identifier` instead of `id` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses the abbreviation `id` instead of the full term `identifier`.

## Rule description

XML documentation should avoid using the abbreviation `id` and instead clearly state `identifier` as they actually are identifiers.
This ensures clarity and precision, making the documentation more understandable and accessible for developers.

### Rationale behind

Abbreviations like `id` can be ambiguous and may not be immediately clear to all developers, especially those who are less experienced or not native English speakers.
The full term `identifier` is explicit and leaves no room for misinterpretation.

Professional documentation should favor clarity over brevity.
While `id` saves a few characters, it reduces the professionalism and clarity of the documentation.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Enhanced Clarity**:
  The term `identifier` is unambiguous and clearly communicates what the value represents.

- **Better Accessibility**:
  Full terms are easier to understand for developers with varying levels of experience and language backgrounds.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Using complete terms rather than abbreviations demonstrates attention to quality and clarity.

- **Consistent Terminology**:
  Using `identifier` aligns with formal technical writing standards and best practices.

- **Improved Searchability**:
  Full terms make documentation easier to search and index in documentation tools.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace instances of `id` with `identifier` in the documentation.
