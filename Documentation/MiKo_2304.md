# MiKo_2304: Do not formulate comments as questions

## Cause

A comment is formulated as a question instead of providing information or explanation.

## Rule description

Comments should clarify the code and the reasoning behind it, never posing questions.
If questions appear in comments, it signals unresolved issues and makes the code hard to maintain over time, as these questions often remain unanswered.
Proper documentation ensures long-term clarity and maintainability.

### Rationale behind

Questions in comments indicate uncertainty or incomplete understanding.
They suggest that the developer was unsure about something but left the question unresolved instead of finding the answer.
This creates technical debt and confusion for future maintainers.

Avoiding questions in comments provides several important benefits:

- **Signals Incomplete Work**:
  Questions in comments clearly indicate that something was not fully understood or resolved.
  This suggests the code may have bugs or unexpected behavior.

- **Prevents Uncertainty**:
  Future developers encountering questions in comments do not know whether the question was answered, whether the code is correct, or what action to take.
  This creates uncertainty and risk.

- **Encourages Resolution**:
  Prohibiting questions in comments forces developers to find answers before committing code.
  This leads to better understanding and more reliable implementations.

- **Improves Maintainability**:
  Code with unresolved questions is difficult to maintain.
  Developers must investigate and answer questions that should have been resolved originally.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Questions in comments should raise red flags during code review.
  They indicate that the code is not ready to be merged.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Production code should not contain unresolved questions.
  Comments should provide clear information and explanations, demonstrating thorough understanding.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, investigate the question, find the answer, and rewrite the comment as a statement that explains the code.
If the question cannot be answered, the code may need to be redesigned or further investigated before being committed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2304
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2304
```
