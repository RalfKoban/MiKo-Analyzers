# MiKo_1093: Do not use the suffix `Object` or `Struct`

## Cause

A name ends with `Object` or `Struct`.

## Rule description

Avoid using `Object` or `Struct` as suffixes in identifiers.
Often, better names can be chosen that do not include these terms, like `Identifier` instead of `IdentificationObject`.

### Rationale behind

Using `Object` or `Struct` as suffixes in names is redundant and creates unnecessary noise in the code.
Everything in object-oriented programming is either an object or a struct, so these suffixes add no meaningful information.
They simply repeat what the type system already conveys.

Avoiding these suffixes provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Names without these redundant suffixes are shorter and easier to read.
  Developers can focus on the actual purpose of the type rather than being distracted by unnecessary type category information.

- **More Meaningful Names**:
  When forced to avoid `Object` or `Struct`, developers are encouraged to choose names that better describe what the type actually represents.
  This leads to more expressive and self-documenting code.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Avoiding these suffixes creates a more consistent naming pattern across the codebase.
  This makes it easier for developers to predict and understand type names.

- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**:
  Shorter names are easier to work with when refactoring or renaming types.
  There is less to type and less chance of making mistakes.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Code without these redundant suffixes looks cleaner and more professional.
  This makes the codebase more pleasant to work with and easier to review.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Object` or `Struct` suffix and choose a more descriptive name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1093
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1093
```
