# MiKo_3210: Make only the longest overloads virtual or abstract

## Cause

A method overload that is not the longest overload is marked as `virtual` or `abstract`.

## Rule description

Overloads are methods with the same name within a type.
Generally, those with fewer parameters call the ones with more parameters, providing default values.

When inheritance requires overriding such methods, override the overload with the most parameters.
The same rule applies to abstract methods.
This approach maintains consistency and clarity in your code.

### Rationale behind

Method overloads typically form a chain where shorter overloads call longer ones with default parameter values.
Making shorter overloads virtual creates confusion about which method should be overridden and can lead to inconsistent behavior.

Making only the longest overload virtual provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  It is immediately clear which method contains the actual implementation.
  Developers know exactly which method to override.

- **Better Consistency**:
  All overloads call through to the longest one, ensuring consistent behavior.
  Overriding the longest overload affects all callers.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Having a single override point simplifies inheritance hierarchies.
  There is no confusion about which overload to customize.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Changes to behavior only need to be made in one place.
  All overloads automatically reflect the changes.

- **Clearer Design**:
  The design pattern of overloads calling a central implementation is more obvious.
  This follows established .NET patterns.

- **Prevented Errors**:
  Limiting virtual overloads prevents inconsistent implementations.
  Derived classes cannot accidentally override the wrong method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `virtual` or `abstract` modifier from shorter overloads.
Apply the modifier only to the overload with the most parameters.
Ensure shorter overloads call the longest overload with appropriate default values.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3210
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3210
```
