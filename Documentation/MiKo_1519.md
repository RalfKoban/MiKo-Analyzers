# MiKo_1519: Do not prefix or suffix parameters with `reference`

## Cause

A parameter name contains `reference` as a prefix or suffix.

## Rule description

Reference types in .NET are already references, so adding `Reference` to parameter names is redundant.
Use names that describe the object's role, not its implementation detail.

Using clear, role-based names instead of implementation details improves code readability and maintainability.

### Rationale behind

Method parameters form the public contract of your methods.
Including redundant information like `reference` in parameter names clutters the API and distracts from the actual meaning of the parameters.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Cleaner Method Signatures**:
  A method signature like `ProcessOrder(Order order)` is clean and clear.
  `ProcessOrder(Order orderReference)` adds unnecessary complexity without providing value.

- **Better API Documentation**:
  Auto-generated documentation and IntelliSense should describe what parameters represent in business terms.
  `reference` is a technical detail that does not help users understand how to call the method.

- **Reduced Caller Confusion**:
  When callers see parameter names with `reference`, they might wonder if there is a difference between a reference and a non-reference parameter.
  In .NET, all reference types are already references, so this distinction does not exist.

- **Consistency with Framework APIs**:
  The .NET Framework never uses `reference` in parameter names.
  Following this pattern makes your APIs feel more professional and aligned with platform conventions.

- **Shorter Parameter Names**:
  Removing `reference` makes parameter names more concise, improving readability of method signatures and call sites, especially when using named arguments.

- **Focus on Domain Concepts**:
  Parameter names should communicate domain concepts and business requirements.
  Implementation details like whether something is a reference or value type belong in the type system, not in names.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to remove `reference` from its name and use a name that describes its role.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1519
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1519
```
