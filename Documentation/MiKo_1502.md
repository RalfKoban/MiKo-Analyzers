# MiKo_1502: Do not use `Process` in names

## Cause

A name contains the term `Process`.

## Rule description

When naming something `Process`, it is not clear what is processed, why it is processed and what the result after processing is.
It is better to when the name contains the purpose behind it.

Using clear and specific names improves code readability and helps developers quickly understand the intent and behavior of the code.

Example:
"ProcessMessages" could be renamed to "DeleteObsoleteMessages" or similar if the purpose of processing messages is to detect and delete obsolete ones.

### Rationale behind

Generic verbs like `Process` hide the true intention of the code and force developers to dig into the implementation to understand what actually happens.
This creates unnecessary friction in development and code maintenance.

Using descriptive names provides several important benefits:

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Names like `DeleteObsoleteMessages` or `ValidateIncomingOrders` tell you exactly what the method does without needing to read the implementation.
  This makes the code act as its own documentation.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  When searching for specific functionality, descriptive names make it much easier to find the right method.
  `Process` methods can do anything, making them harder to locate.

- **Better Design Decisions**:
  When forced to name a method with its actual purpose, developers often realize if a method is doing too much.
  This naturally leads to better code organization and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.

- **Improved Team Communication**:
  Team members can discuss specific functionality more effectively when methods have clear, descriptive names.
  "The ProcessMessages method" is vague, while "The DeleteObsoleteMessages method" is precise.

- **Reduced Bugs**:
  Clear names reduce misunderstandings about what a method does, leading to fewer bugs from incorrect usage or assumptions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the element to use a more specific term that describes what is being processed and what the result is.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1502
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1502
```
