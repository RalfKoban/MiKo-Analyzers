# MiKo_6041: Place assignments on same line(s)

## Cause

Assignments are split across multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when assignments are placed on the same lines.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Assignment operations are fundamental building blocks of code that store values in variables.
When assignments are split across multiple lines unnecessarily, they become harder to read and the relationship between the variable and its value becomes less clear.

Placing assignments on the same lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete assignment operation is visible at a glance, making it immediately clear what value is being assigned to which variable.
  Developers can understand the operation without scanning multiple lines.

- **Clearer Data Flow**:
  Compact assignments make it easier to track how data flows through the code.
  Developers can quickly identify where variables get their values and how they change over time.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When an assignment fits on one line, it can be processed as a single unit of information.
  Developers do not need to mentally combine pieces from multiple lines to understand what is happening.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Compact assignments make it easier to scan through code and identify variable initializations and updates.
  This is especially helpful when looking for where a specific variable gets its value.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Assignment statements read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows the expected pattern and makes the code more intuitive to understand.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify assignments during code reviews when they are compact and self-contained.
  It is easier to check that the correct value is being assigned to the correct variable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the assignment operator and the assigned value to the same line as the variable.
Ensure that the complete assignment statement is on a single line when reasonable.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6041
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6041
```
