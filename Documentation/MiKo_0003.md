# MiKo_0003: Keep types small

## Cause

A type contains too many lines of code.

## Rule description

To make code easier to read and maintain, types should be kept small.
When a type becomes too large, it often indicates that it has too many responsibilities and is violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Large types are harder to understand, test, and maintain, making the codebase more difficult to work with.

### Rationale behind

When a type becomes too large, it often indicates that it has too many responsibilities.
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that a class should have only one reason to change.

Keeping types small provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Understandability**:
  Large types are difficult to understand.
  Reading through hundreds of lines of code makes it hard to grasp what the type does and how it works.
  This increases the learning curve for new team members and slows down development.

- **Easier Testing**:
  Testing becomes more complex with large types.
  More code means more test cases are needed to cover all scenarios.
  Setting up tests for a type with many dependencies and responsibilities is time-consuming and error-prone.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Maintenance becomes harder as types grow.
  Finding and fixing bugs in a large type takes more time because there is more code to search through.
  Making changes becomes risky because it is not always clear how different parts of the type interact with each other.

- **Enhanced Reusability**:
  Large types also make it harder to reuse code.
  When a type does many things, it cannot be reused in situations where only some of its functionality is needed.
  This leads to code duplication and inconsistency across the codebase.

- **Improved Code Organization**:
  Keeping types small and focused improves code organization.
  Smaller types are easier to name appropriately, making the codebase more self-documenting.
  Well-organized code with clear responsibilities is easier to navigate and understand.

- **Better Collaboration**:
  Small types also enable better collaboration.
  Multiple developers can work on different small types simultaneously without conflicts.
  Code reviews become more effective because reviewers can focus on one responsibility at a time.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the type into smaller, more focused types.
Each type should have a single responsibility.

Look for groups of related functionality within your type that can be extracted into separate classes.
Give these new classes meaningful names that describe their purpose.

Consider using design patterns like delegation or composition to split responsibilities across multiple types.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_0003
#pragma warning restore MiKo_0003
```
