# MiKo_3108: Include assertions in test methods

## Cause

A test method does not contain any assertions.

## Rule description

Tests need assertions to verify code behavior.
Without an assertion, the test does not check anything and is not useful.
This ensures tests are effective and the code works as expected.

### Rationale behind

The fundamental purpose of a test is to verify that code behaves correctly.
Without assertions, a test merely executes code but provides no verification that the results are correct.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Ensures Effective Testing**:
  Tests without assertions do not verify anything, making them useless for quality assurance.
  Adding assertions ensures each test actually validates expected behavior.

- **Prevents False Confidence**:
  Tests that pass without assertions give a false sense of security.
  Developers might believe code is tested when it is actually not verified at all.

- **Catches Actual Bugs**:
  Assertions are what detect bugs and regressions in the code.
  Without them, bugs can slip through unnoticed even when tests are run.

- **Improves Code Quality**:
  Meaningful assertions ensure that code not only runs without throwing exceptions but also produces correct results.
  This leads to higher quality and more reliable software.

- **Better Test Documentation**:
  Assertions document what behavior is expected from the code.
  They serve as executable specifications that clarify how the code should work.

- **Supports Refactoring**:
  Assertions provide the safety net needed to refactor code with confidence.
  Without them, refactoring becomes risky because there is no verification that behavior remains correct.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code under test.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3108
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3108
```
