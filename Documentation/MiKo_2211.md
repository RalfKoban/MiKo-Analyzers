# MiKo_2211: Do not use `<remarks>` sections for enum members

## Cause

An enum member has a `<remarks>` section in its documentation.

## Rule description

Tools like Sandcastle cannot process `<remarks>` sections on enum members, meaning the resulting output (CHM, HTML, etc.) will not include these sections.
Since developers often use HTML/CHM documentation when working with third-party frameworks, crucial information in the `<remarks>` section may be inaccessible.

To ensure developers have all the necessary information, it is best to place this information inside the `<summary>` section instead.
This guarantees that all essential details are included in the output documentation.

### Rationale behind

Documentation generation tools have limitations in how they process different documentation elements for different member types.
Enum members are treated differently from classes or methods, and many tools do not render `<remarks>` sections for them.

When important information is placed in `<remarks>` for enum members, it effectively becomes invisible in generated documentation.
This can lead to developers missing critical information about how to use enum values correctly.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Ensured Visibility**:
  All documentation content appears in generated output when placed in the `<summary>` section.

- **Complete Information**:
  Developers see all important details about enum members in IntelliSense and generated documentation.

- **Tool Compatibility**:
  Documentation works correctly with all standard documentation generation tools.

- **Prevented Information Loss**:
  No important details are hidden in sections that will not be rendered.

- **Better User Experience**:
  Developers have access to complete information regardless of how they view the documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move content from the `<remarks>` section into the `<summary>` section for enum members.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2211
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2211
```
