# MiKo_1078: Start builder method names with `Build`

## Cause

A method in a builder class does not start with `Build`.

## Rule description

The method belongs to a builder and therefore its name should be started with `Build`.

### Rationale behind

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
The pattern establishes a convention where the final method that returns the constructed object should clearly signal that it is performing the build operation.

Using `Build` as a prefix for builder methods makes it immediately clear that the method is completing the construction process and returning the final object.
This naming aligns with how developers expect builder patterns to work based on common practices.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Pattern Recognition**:
  Using `Build` makes it immediately obvious that the class follows the Builder pattern, helping developers understand the code structure faster.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `Build` prefix clearly signals that this method finalizes the object construction and returns the result, distinguishing it from methods that configure the builder.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers familiar with the Builder pattern will naturally look for a method starting with `Build` to complete the construction process.

- **Consistent API**:
  Following a standard naming convention across all builders in a codebase creates a predictable, easy-to-use API.

- **Better Code Readability**:
  When builder methods are named consistently, code that uses them becomes more readable and self-documenting.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  Developers new to the codebase can quickly understand how to use builders when they follow established naming patterns.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to start with `Build`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1078
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1078
