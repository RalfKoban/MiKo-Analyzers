# MiKo_6001: Surround log statements with blank lines

## Cause

Logging calls are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround logging calls with blank lines to visually separate them from business code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding log statements with blank lines is essential for maintaining clear separation between diagnostic code and business logic.
Logging statements serve a different purpose than the core functionality of the code, and visually separating them helps developers focus on the business logic while still being able to easily locate and review logging operations.

Surrounding log statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Separation**:
  Blank lines create a visual boundary between logging operations and business logic.
  This makes it immediately obvious which code is for diagnostics versus which implements actual functionality.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When log statements are visually separated, the business logic becomes easier to read.
  Developers can follow the main code flow without being distracted by logging calls.

- **Better Focus on Business Logic**:
  Visual separation allows developers to concentrate on the core functionality.
  The blank lines signal that logging is supplementary to the main logic.

- **Easier Code Maintenance**:
  When log statements are clearly separated, adding or removing logging is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where logging occurs without affecting surrounding code.

- **Simplified Code Review**:
  During code reviews, separated log statements are easier to identify and verify.
  Reviewers can quickly check logging appropriateness without getting lost in business logic.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Visually distinct log statements are easier to locate when debugging.
  Developers can quickly find relevant logging calls without scanning through dense code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after logging statements.
Ensure each logging call is visually separated from the surrounding business logic.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6001
```
