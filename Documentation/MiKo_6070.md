# MiKo_6070: Surround Console statements with blank lines

## Cause

Console input/output statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround Console input/output with blank lines to visually separate them from business code.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding Console statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear visual separation between different types of code.
Console operations are typically infrastructure or diagnostic code that serve a different purpose than core business logic, and visually separating them helps developers distinguish between these different concerns.

Surrounding Console statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Separation**:
  Blank lines create a visual boundary between Console operations and business logic.
  This makes it immediately obvious where input/output operations occur versus where the actual logic resides.

- **Improved Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into logical sections.
  Console statements stand out as distinct operations rather than being buried within business logic.

- **Better Readability**:
  When Console statements are surrounded by blank lines, the code is easier to read.
  Developers can quickly identify where the program interacts with the console.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  During code reviews, visually separated Console statements are easier to spot.
  Reviewers can quickly identify input/output operations and verify they are appropriate.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When Console statements are clearly separated, removing or modifying them is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious what needs to be changed without affecting surrounding code.

- **Better Focus on Business Logic**:
  Separating Console statements allows developers to focus on the core business logic without being distracted by input/output operations.
  The clear separation reduces cognitive load.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after Console statements.
Ensure each Console operation is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6070
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6070
```
