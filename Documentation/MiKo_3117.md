# MiKo_3117: Include code in test cleanup methods

## Cause

A test cleanup method (such as methods marked with `[TearDown]` or `[OneTimeTearDown]`) is empty.

## Rule description

Empty unit test cleanup methods clutter the codebase and serve no purpose.
They can be safely removed to keep the code clean and maintainable.

### Rationale behind

Test cleanup methods exist to release resources, reset state, or perform other cleanup tasks after tests complete.
When these methods are empty, they provide no functionality and add unnecessary complexity to the test class.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Reduces Code Clutter**:
  Empty cleanup methods add lines of code that serve no purpose.
  Removing them makes test classes cleaner and easier to navigate.

- **Improves Readability**:
  Developers seeing a cleanup method expect it to perform cleanup work.
  Empty methods violate this expectation and can cause confusion.

- **Eliminates Maintenance Overhead**:
  Empty methods still need to be maintained and considered during refactoring.
  Removing them reduces unnecessary work.

- **Prevents Misleading Code**:
  An empty `[TearDown]` method suggests that cleanup is needed, which is not the case.
  This can mislead developers about the test's resource management.

- **Keeps Tests Focused**:
  Removing unnecessary code helps keep test classes focused on actual testing.
  There are fewer distractions from the important test logic.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Tests without empty methods have clearer structure.
  Developers can immediately see what cleanup is actually performed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the empty test cleanup method.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3117
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3117
```
