# MiKo_4005: Place the interface that gives a type its name directly after the type's declaration

## Cause

The interface that gives a type its name is not listed first in the type's interface list.

## Rule description

List the interface that gives the type its name first, followed by all other implemented interfaces.
This organization ensures clarity and makes the code easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

When a type is named after an interface it implements, that interface represents the primary purpose and identity of the type.

Placing this interface first in the interface list immediately communicates the main role of the type and makes the code more intuitive and self-documenting.

Placing the naming interface first provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Intent Recognition**:
  When the primary interface appears first, developers can instantly understand the main purpose of the type.
  The naming relationship becomes immediately obvious.

- **Better Code Documentation**:
  The interface order serves as self-documenting code, showing which interface is most important.
  Developers do not need to guess which interface defines the type's primary contract.

- **Improved Readability**:
  A consistent pattern where the naming interface comes first makes all type declarations easier to read.
  Developers can quickly scan code and understand type relationships.

- **Clearer Type Hierarchy**:
  Highlighting the primary interface first makes it easier to understand inheritance relationships and design patterns.
  The main contract stands out from supporting or utility interfaces.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that types implement their primary interface correctly.
  The prominent placement makes it hard to miss the main contract.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  When a type implements multiple interfaces, placing the naming interface first eliminates ambiguity about which interface represents the core functionality.
  The primary purpose is always clear.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reorder the implemented interfaces so that the interface which gives the type its name appears first in the list.

All other interfaces should follow after the primary interface.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4005
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4005
```
