# MiKo_1408: Place extension methods in same namespace as the extended types

## Cause

Extension methods are not in the same namespace as the types they extend.

## Rule description

Extension methods should be placed in the same namespace as the types they extend, so they are automatically available when the extended type is used without requiring an additional `using` directive.

### Rationale behind

Placing extension methods in the same namespace as the types they extend is crucial for developer productivity and API usability.
When extensions are in the same namespace as the extended type, they appear automatically in IntelliSense whenever the extended type is in scope.
This makes them feel like natural members of the type.

Co-locating extension methods with extended types provides several important benefits:

- **Automatic Availability**:
  Extensions appear automatically in IntelliSense when the extended type is in scope.
  Developers do not need to remember or discover additional using directives.

- **Natural API Feel**:
  Extensions feel like natural members of the type rather than external additions.
  This creates a more intuitive and cohesive API surface.

- **Reduced Friction**:
  Developers can immediately use extension methods without additional configuration.
  This eliminates the common frustration of knowing a method exists but not being able to find it.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Extensions are immediately visible when working with the extended type.
  This is especially helpful for developers who are new to the codebase.

- **Better Developer Experience**:
  Developers can discover and use extensions through normal IntelliSense exploration.
  This makes the API more intuitive and easier to learn.

- **Prevented Confusion**:
  Extensions in separate namespaces often go undiscovered or require documentation to explain their existence.
  Co-location eliminates this problem entirely.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the extension methods to the namespace of the extended type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1408
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1408
```
