# MiKo_1509: Do not suffix parameters with pattern names

## Cause

A parameter name is suffixed with a pattern name.

## Rule description

Prefer naming parameters using prefixes to describe their role rather than suffixes to describe their type.
This improves code readability, avoids confusion with class names and helps developers quickly understand the purpose of the parameter in context.

Using descriptive names based on purpose rather than type makes code more maintainable and easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Method parameters are the primary way to communicate what a method expects from its callers.
Naming parameters based on design patterns rather than their business purpose obscures the method's intent and makes the API harder to understand.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Method Contracts**:
  A method signature like `ProcessPayment(IPaymentStrategy strategy)` focuses on the technical pattern.
  `ProcessPayment(IPaymentMethod paymentMethod)` describes what the parameter represents in business terms, making the contract clearer.

- **Better API Usability**:
  When developers use your API, they think in terms of business concepts, not design patterns.
  Parameter names should match their mental model to reduce friction and errors.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  New team members or API users should not need to understand your implementation patterns to use a method correctly.
  Role-based names make the API accessible without requiring deep architectural knowledge.

- **Improved IntelliSense Experience**:
  IDE tooltips and IntelliSense display parameter names.
  Descriptive business names provide more useful information than pattern names when developers are writing code.

- **Future-Proof APIs**:
  If you refactor your implementation to use a different pattern, role-based parameter names remain valid.
  Pattern-based names would require breaking changes to the API signature.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to use a prefix that describes its role instead of a suffix that describes its type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1509
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1509
```
