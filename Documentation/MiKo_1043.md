# MiKo_1043: Use specific name for `CancellationToken` variables

## Cause

A variable of type `CancellationToken` is not named according to the standard convention.

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance and align with .NET Framework standards, `CancellationToken` variables should be consistently named.
This helps keep the code clear and consistent.

The standard name for a `CancellationToken` variable is `token`.
This convention is used throughout the .NET Framework and should be followed in the code.

### Rationale behind

Using a consistent name for `CancellationToken` variables makes the code more predictable and easier to understand.
When all code follows the same naming convention, developers can quickly recognize the purpose of variables without having to read documentation.

Using the standard `token` name for local variables provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  A consistent variable name makes the code easier to scan and understand.
  Developers immediately recognize `token` as the standard variable for cancellation support.

- **Consistency with .NET Standards**:
  The .NET Framework uses `token` as the standard variable name throughout its implementation code.
  Following this convention makes the code feel familiar to anyone working with .NET.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to remember different variable names for the same concept across different methods.
  A single standard name simplifies understanding and reduces mental effort.

- **Shorter Code**:
  The name `token` is concise while still being descriptive.
  This keeps lines shorter and more readable compared to longer names like `cancellationToken` for local variables.

- **Clear Distinction from Parameters**:
  Using `token` for local variables and `cancellationToken` for parameters helps distinguish between different scopes.
  This makes it easier to understand the flow of cancellation tokens through the code.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly spot when cancellation tokens are being used correctly without having to decipher non-standard names.
  This makes code reviews faster and more effective.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `CancellationToken` variable to `token`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1043
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1043
```
