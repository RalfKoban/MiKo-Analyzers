# MiKo_1515: Express binary conditions clearly in boolean property names

## Cause

A boolean property name uses an abstract noun instead of an adjective or predicate.

## Rule description

Prefer naming boolean properties using adjectives or predicates to express a binary condition rather than abstract nouns.
This improves code clarity, avoids ambiguity, and helps developers immediately understand the true/false nature of the value.

Using clear, descriptive names for boolean properties makes code more readable and maintainable.

## Rationale

Boolean properties represent binary states that should be expressed as conditions that are either true or false.
Abstract nouns obscure this binary nature and make code harder to read and understand.

Using adjectives or predicates provides several important benefits:

- **Natural Reading Flow**:
  Code like `if (connection.IsActive)` reads naturally as English.
  `if (connection.Activity)` is awkward and unclear whether it checks for any activity or active state.

- **Clear True/False Meaning**:
  Properties like `IsValid`, `HasErrors`, or `CanExecute` clearly indicate what true and false mean.
  Abstract nouns like `Validity`, `Errors`, or `Execution` leave developers guessing about the boolean interpretation.

- **Better IntelliSense Guidance**:
  When developers see boolean properties starting with `Is`, `Has`, `Can`, or `Should`, they immediately know it returns a boolean.
  Abstract nouns provide no such hint, requiring developers to check the type.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers should not have to mentally translate abstract nouns into boolean conditions.
  Using predicates eliminates this mental overhead and speeds up code comprehension.

- **Consistency with .NET Conventions**:
  The .NET Framework consistently uses predicates for boolean properties: `String.IsNullOrEmpty`, `File.Exists`, `List.Contains`.
  Following this pattern makes your code feel more familiar and professional.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly scan boolean conditions when properties use standard predicates.
  Abstract nouns slow down reviews and increase the chance of misunderstanding the logic.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the property to use an adjective or predicate that clearly expresses a binary condition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1515
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1515
```
