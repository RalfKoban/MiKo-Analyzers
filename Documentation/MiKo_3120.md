# MiKo_3120: Use direct values instead of `It.Is<>(...)` condition matcher to verify exact values in Moq mocks

## Cause

A test method uses `It.Is<T>()` condition matcher with an exact value comparison instead of passing the value directly.

## Rule description

Moq's condition matchers are meant to verify that parts of an argument meet specific criteria.
However, they should not be used to test for exact value matches.
In those cases, provide the exact values instead of using a condition matcher.
This ensures precision in tests and maintains clear expectations.

### Rationale behind

Condition matchers in Moq are designed for scenarios where argument values need to satisfy certain conditions rather than match exact values.
Using them for exact matches adds unnecessary complexity and obscures the test's intent.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Direct values are immediately clear and require no analysis.
  Condition matchers require developers to read and understand the lambda expression to determine what is expected.

- **Simpler Test Code**:
  Using direct values results in cleaner, more concise mock setups and verifications.
  Condition matchers add extra syntax and complexity for no benefit when checking exact values.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Direct values explicitly show what exact parameter is expected.
  Condition matchers suggest that some variation in the value might be acceptable, which is misleading.

- **Better Performance**:
  Direct value matching is faster than executing lambda expressions for each call.
  Although the difference is small, it adds up across large test suites.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When a mock verification fails with a direct value, the error message is straightforward.
  Condition matcher failures can be less clear about what exactly did not match.

- **Follows Framework Best Practices**:
  Moq documentation recommends using condition matchers for complex conditions, not simple equality.
  Direct values are the idiomatic way to verify exact arguments.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `It.Is<T>(x => x == value)` with the direct value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3120
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3120
```
