# MiKo_1088: Name singleton instances `Instance`

## Cause

A singleton property or field is not named `Instance`.

## Rule description

Singleton properties or fields should be named `Instance` as a convention.
This standard name makes it immediately clear that the class follows the singleton pattern.

### Rationale behind

The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.
Using `Instance` as the standard name for accessing this single instance is a widely recognized convention in software development.
When developers see a property named `Instance`, they immediately understand that they are working with a singleton.

Naming singleton members `Instance` provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  The name `Instance` is a well-established convention that signals singleton usage.
  Developers instantly understand the pattern being used without having to examine the implementation.

- **Consistent Conventions**:
  Following the standard `Instance` naming makes the codebase more predictable and easier to navigate.
  Different names like `Current` or `Default` do not convey the singleton pattern as clearly.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Names like `Current` or `Default` might suggest different patterns or behaviors.
  `Instance` specifically indicates the singleton pattern without ambiguity.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  When developers look for a singleton instance, they know to look for `Instance`.
  Inconsistent naming forces developers to search through documentation or code.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  The name `Instance` serves as inline documentation, making it clear that this member provides access to the singleton instance.
  This reduces the need for additional comments.

- **Industry Standards**:
  The `Instance` naming convention is used across many frameworks and libraries.
  Following this standard makes code more familiar to developers from different backgrounds.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the singleton member to `Instance`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1088
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1088
```
