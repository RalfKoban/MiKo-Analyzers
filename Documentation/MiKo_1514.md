# MiKo_1514: Do not suffix types with `Info`

## Cause

A type name is suffixed with `Info`.

## Rule description

The `Info` suffix is too generic and does not clearly convey the purpose or structure of a type.
Replacing it with more descriptive and intent-revealing names (such as `Data`, `Descriptor`, `Details`, `Metadata`, `Overview`, `Profile`, `Settings`, `Snapshot`, `Status` or `Summary`) improves code readability, simplifies maintenance, and enhances discoverability through better IntelliSense support.
It also reduces confusion, so developers do not have to guess what the type represents.

Using more specific names helps make the code's intent clear and improves maintainability.

## Rationale

The suffix `Info` is overused and vague, providing almost no semantic information about what the type actually contains or how it should be used.
This forces developers to constantly look up the type definition to understand its purpose.

Using more specific suffixes provides several important benefits:

- **Self-Documenting Types**:
  A type named `UserProfile` immediately tells you it contains profile information about a user.
  `UserInfo` could contain anything user-related, requiring you to check the implementation.

- **Better Type Differentiation**:
  In a system, you might need `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`, and `UserStatus`.
  If all were named with `Info` (`UserInfo`, `UserSettingsInfo`, `UserStatusInfo`), it becomes harder to distinguish their purposes.

- **Improved IntelliSense Experience**:
  When developers type `User`, they see descriptive options like `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`, `UserStatus`.
  This helps them find the right type faster than scanning through generic names like `UserInfo`, `UserBasicInfo`, `UserDetailInfo`.

- **Clearer API Contracts**:
  Method signatures like `GetUserProfile()` communicate more than `GetUserInfo()`.
  Callers immediately understand what kind of data they will receive.

- **Easier Code Understanding**:
  When reading code, specific type names reduce cognitive load.
  Developers do not have to keep remembering what each `Info` type contains.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  More specific names help organize related types logically.
  `OrderSummary`, `OrderDetails`, and `OrderStatus` clearly indicate a hierarchy, while multiple `Info` types create ambiguity.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to replace `Info` with a more descriptive and intent-revealing suffix.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1514
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1514
```
