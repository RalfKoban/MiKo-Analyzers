# MiKo_3098: Provide meaningful explanations for suppressed messages

## Cause

A `[SuppressMessage]` attribute does not provide a meaningful justification or only contains generic text like "Reviewed."

## Rule description

When suppressing messages with the `[SuppressMessage]` attribute, a justification must be provided.
This justification should explain why the message was suppressed, helping future developers understand the reasoning.
Just writing "Reviewed." or providing no explanation is not sufficient.
This practice ensures clarity and transparency in the codebase.

### Rationale behind

Code analysis warnings exist to identify potential issues, code smells, or violations of best practices.
When these warnings are suppressed, it is essential to document why the suppression is appropriate, otherwise the reasoning is lost and future developers might question the decision.

Providing meaningful suppression justifications offers several important benefits:

- **Preserves Design Decisions**:
  Suppression justifications document why a particular design choice was made that violates a general rule.
  This preserves the reasoning behind the decision for future reference.

- **Prevents Premature Removal**:
  Without justification, developers might remove suppressions thinking they are no longer needed or were added by mistake.
  Clear justifications prevent accidental removal of intentional suppressions.

- **Aids Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can verify that suppressions are appropriate when they include meaningful explanations.
  Generic justifications like "Reviewed" do not provide enough context for effective review.

- **Supports Maintenance**:
  When code is maintained years later, justifications help developers understand why the warning was suppressed.
  This prevents wasted time investigating whether the suppression is still valid.

- **Improves Code Quality**:
  Requiring meaningful justifications encourages developers to think carefully about whether suppression is truly necessary.
  This can lead to fixing the underlying issue instead of suppressing the warning.

- **Documents Special Cases**:
  Some suppressions are needed for edge cases, framework limitations, or interoperability requirements.
  Justifications document these special cases so they are not forgotten or misunderstood.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the `Justification` parameter of the `[SuppressMessage]` attribute with a meaningful explanation.
The justification should explain specifically why the warning is being suppressed for this particular case, such as explaining that the pattern is required for framework compatibility, performance requirements, or that a specific design decision was made after careful consideration.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3098
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3098
```
