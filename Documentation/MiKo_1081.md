# MiKo_1081: Do not suffix methods with a number

## Cause

A method name ends with a number.

## Rule description

Method names that end with numbers confuse developers about which method to use or whether the methods need to be used together.
Clear, descriptive method names communicate intent and purpose much better than numbered suffixes.

### Rationale behind

Numbered method suffixes provide no meaningful information about what the method does.
When developers see methods named `ProcessData1` and `ProcessData2`, they cannot tell the difference without reading the implementation.
This makes code harder to understand and maintain.

Using descriptive method names instead of number suffixes provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Descriptive names like `ProcessUserData` and `ProcessOrderData` immediately communicate what each method does.
  Developers do not have to guess or investigate the method implementation to understand its purpose.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  When using IntelliSense or code completion, descriptive names make it easy to find the right method.
  Number suffixes force developers to remember which number corresponds to which functionality.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When fixing bugs or adding features, descriptive names help developers quickly locate the relevant method.
  With numbered methods, developers might need to check multiple methods to find the right one.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Descriptive method names act as documentation, reducing the need for comments.
  The method name itself explains what the method does.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Numbered suffixes often indicate that the code needs refactoring.
  Using descriptive names encourages better code design and clearer separation of responsibilities.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method with a descriptive name instead of using a number suffix.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1081
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1081
```
