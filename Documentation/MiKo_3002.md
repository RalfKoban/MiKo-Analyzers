# MiKo_3002: Limit class dependencies

## Cause

A class has too many dependencies injected through its constructor.

## Rule description

If a class has too many dependencies, it's taking on too many responsibilities and violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
This indicates a need for refactoring the class into smaller, more focused units, ensuring the codebase remains clean and manageable.

### Rationale behind

Classes with too many dependencies are difficult to understand, test, and maintain.
A high number of dependencies is a clear indicator that the class is doing too much and needs to be split into smaller, more focused components.

Limiting class dependencies provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Testability**:
  Classes with fewer dependencies are easier to test.
  Fewer mocks and stubs are needed, making unit tests simpler and more maintainable.

- **Better Adherence to Single Responsibility Principle**:
  When a class has many dependencies, it usually means it is handling multiple responsibilities.
  Splitting it into focused classes ensures each class has one clear purpose.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  Classes with fewer dependencies are easier to understand.
  Developers can quickly grasp what the class does without having to understand many different collaborators.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Changes to classes with fewer dependencies are less risky.
  There are fewer points of interaction that could be affected by a modification.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Breaking down complex classes into smaller ones leads to a more organized codebase.
  Each component has a clear role, making the overall architecture easier to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the class into smaller classes with fewer responsibilities.
Extract related functionality into separate classes and reduce the number of constructor dependencies.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3002
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3002
```
