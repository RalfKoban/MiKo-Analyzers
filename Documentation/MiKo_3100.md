# MiKo_3100: Place test classes in same namespace as types under test

## Cause

A test class is not placed in the same namespace as the type it tests.

## Rule description

To ease maintenance, place test classes in the same namespace as the type they test.
This approach eliminates arbitrary `using` directives, mirrors the project structure, and makes discovering tests much easier.

### Rationale behind

Placing test classes in the same namespace as the types under test is important for maintaining a clear and organized test structure.
When tests are located in the same namespace as production code, the relationship between tests and the code they verify becomes immediately obvious.

This practice provides several important benefits:

- **Easier Test Discovery**:
  Developers can quickly find the tests for a specific type without searching through different namespaces.
  The namespace directly indicates which production code is being tested.

- **Reduced Namespace Clutter**:
  Eliminating arbitrary `using` directives makes test files cleaner and easier to read.
  There is no need to import additional namespaces just to access the types under test.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  The test project structure mirrors the production code structure, making navigation intuitive and consistent.
  This parallel organization helps developers understand the codebase layout more quickly.

- **Simplified Maintenance**:
  When production code is refactored or reorganized, the corresponding tests are easier to locate and update.
  The clear namespace mapping reduces the risk of orphaned or misplaced tests.

- **Improved Team Consistency**:
  A standard namespace convention across the team creates a predictable test structure that all team members can follow easily.
  New team members can find tests without needing to learn project-specific conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the test class into the same namespace as the type under test.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3100
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3100
```
