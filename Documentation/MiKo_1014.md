# MiKo_1014: Do not use ambiguous `Check` in method names

## Cause

A method name uses the ambiguous term `Check`.

## Rule description

The term `Check` is ambiguous.
If the intention is to validate parameters, use words like `Validate` or `Verify`.
If checking for a specific state, use `Is`, `Can` or `Has` instead.
This makes code more precise and easier to understand.

Using specific terms helps developers immediately understand what the method does without having to read its implementation.

### Rationale behind

The term `Check` is problematic because it lacks specificity and can mean different things in different contexts.
A method named `Check` could be validating input, verifying preconditions, testing a state, or performing any number of other operations.
This ambiguity forces developers to examine the method implementation or documentation to understand its actual purpose, increasing cognitive load and slowing down development.

Using more specific verbs creates self-documenting code.
`Validate` clearly indicates that the method is checking whether something meets certain criteria and possibly throwing exceptions or returning validation results.
`Verify` suggests checking preconditions or assertions.
Boolean query methods with `Is`, `Can`, or `Has` prefixes clearly indicate they return `true` or `false` based on some condition.

Using precise terminology provides several important benefits:

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Specific verbs like `Validate`, `Verify`, `Is`, `Can`, or `Has` immediately convey method behavior.
  Developers understand what the method does without reading implementation or documentation.

- **Improved API Discoverability**:
  When methods use specific, descriptive verbs, they are easier to find through IntelliSense.
  Developers can locate the right method faster.

- **Clearer Return Expectations**:
  Boolean prefixes (`Is`, `Can`, `Has`) clearly indicate the method returns `true` or `false`.
  `Validate` suggests exceptions or validation results.
  This clarity reduces errors.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Precise naming eliminates ambiguity, reducing the mental effort required to understand code.
  Developers can work faster and with greater confidence.

- **Better Code Maintenance**:
  When method names clearly describe their purpose, modifying and debugging code becomes easier.
  The intent is obvious from the method signature.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework uses specific verbs throughout (e.g., `String.IsNullOrEmpty`, not `String.CheckNullOrEmpty`).
  Following these conventions makes custom code feel integrated with the platform.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to use `Validate`, `Verify`, `Is`, `Can`, `Has`, or another specific verb that clearly describes the method's purpose.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1014
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1014
```
