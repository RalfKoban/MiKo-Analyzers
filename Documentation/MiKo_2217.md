# MiKo_2217: Format `<list>` documentation properly

## Cause

The `<list>` documentation is not properly formatted according to the rules for list types.

## Rule description

The documentation of a `<list>` can be ambiguous, as there are three types: `number`, `bullet`, and `table`.

- Only `table` lists can have a single `<listheader>` and multiple `<item>` entries. `Number` and `bullet` lists only have `<item>` entries.
- For `table` lists, each `<listheader>` and `<item>` can contain either a single, optional `<term>` and a single, required `<description>`, or multiple `<term>` entries.
- For `bullet` or `number` lists, each `<item>` can contain a single, optional `<term>` and a single, required `<description>`.
- An `<item>` should never contain multiple `<description>` entries.

This ensures your list documentation is clear and accurately structured.

### Rationale behind

Different list types have different structural requirements, and documentation tools expect lists to follow these rules.
When lists are improperly formatted, documentation tools may not render them correctly or may display errors.

Proper list formatting ensures that the structure matches the intended presentation.
For example, table lists need headers to make sense, while bullet lists should not have headers that will be ignored.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Correct Rendering**:
  Properly formatted lists appear as intended in IntelliSense and generated documentation.

- **Prevented Errors**:
  Following the correct structure prevents documentation generation errors and warnings.

- **Clear Structure**:
  Proper formatting makes the documentation structure obvious to both tools and human readers.

- **Consistent Output**:
  Lists appear correctly across all documentation viewers when properly formatted.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Well-structured lists demonstrate attention to documentation standards and quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, restructure the `<list>` to follow the proper format for its type.
Ensure headers are only used for table lists and that items contain the correct child elements.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2217
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2217
```
