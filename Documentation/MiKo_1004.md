# MiKo_1004: Remove term `Event` from event names

## Cause

An event name ends with the suffix `Event`.

## Rule description

Avoid using `Event` as a suffix in event names because it is unnecessary and adds clutter.

The fact that something is an event is already clear from its declaration using the `event` keyword.
Adding `Event` to the name is redundant and makes the name longer without adding any useful information.

For example, instead of naming an event `ButtonClickEvent`, simply name it `ButtonClick` or `Click`.

### Rationale behind

Removing the `Event` suffix from event names eliminates redundancy and improves code clarity.
The `event` keyword in the declaration already explicitly marks the member as an event, making the suffix completely superfluous.

Including `Event` in the name is analogous to naming a property `UserNameProperty` or a method `CalculateTotalMethod` - it adds technical noise without improving understanding.
Clean event names make code more readable and professional, following the same principle used throughout the .NET Framework where events are named after what happened (e.g., `Click`, `PropertyChanged`, `Closed`) rather than labeled as events.

Removing this redundancy provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter, cleaner event names are easier to read and understand.
  Removing unnecessary suffixes reduces visual clutter in the code.

- **Natural Event Handler Names**:
  Event handlers read more naturally when events have concise names.
  `OnButtonClick` responding to `ButtonClick` is clearer than `OnButtonClickEvent` responding to `ButtonClickEvent`.

- **More Elegant Subscriptions**:
  Event subscriptions become more readable: `button.Click += OnClick` is more elegant than `button.ClickEvent += OnClickEvent`.
  This improves the overall code aesthetics and maintainability.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework never uses `Event` suffixes in event names.
  Following this pattern makes custom code feel integrated with platform conventions.

- **Better API Usability**:
  When designing public APIs, concise event names are more user-friendly.
  They make the API feel polished and professional.

- **Reduced Naming Fatigue**:
  Without the `Event` suffix requirement, naming becomes simpler and more focused on describing what actually happened.
  This reduces the cognitive load of choosing appropriate names.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Well-chosen event names that describe the occurrence (not the fact that it is an event) communicate intent more effectively.
  Names should answer "what happened?" rather than "what kind of member is this?"

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the event to remove the `Event` suffix.
