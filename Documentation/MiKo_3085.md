# MiKo_3085: Keep conditional statements short

## Cause

A conditional (ternary) statement is too long.

## Rule description

Long conditional statements are hard to read and maintain.
Keep them short for easy understanding at a glance, or refactor into if-else statements for clarity.
This approach keeps the code clean and maintainable.

### Rationale behind

Conditional (ternary) statements are useful for simple, concise value assignments.
However, when they become too long or complex, they harm readability and make the code difficult to understand and maintain.

Keeping conditional statements short provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Code Readability**:
  Short conditional statements can be understood at a glance.
  Long conditionals require careful reading and mental parsing to understand the logic, especially when nested or containing complex expressions.

- **Reduces Error Probability**:
  Long conditional statements are more prone to errors because the relationships between conditions, true values, and false values become harder to track.
  Shorter statements make it obvious what value is returned in each case.

- **Simplifies Debugging**:
  When conditional statements are short, it is easier to step through them in a debugger and verify their behavior.
  Long conditionals can be difficult to break down during debugging sessions.

- **Enables Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify the correctness of short conditional statements.
  Long conditionals require significantly more time and attention to review properly.

- **Facilitates Maintenance**:
  When logic needs to be modified, short conditional statements are easier to update correctly.
  Long conditionals often need to be refactored into if-else statements before they can be safely modified.

- **Supports Alternative Patterns**:
  When conditionals become too complex, it usually indicates that the logic should be expressed differently.
  Refactoring to if-else statements, switch expressions, or separate methods often results in clearer code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the long conditional statement into an if-else statement or extract the logic into a separate method.
Break down complex conditions into intermediate boolean variables with meaningful names.
Consider using switch expressions for multiple condition branches.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3085
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3085
```
