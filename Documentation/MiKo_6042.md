# MiKo_6042: Place `new` keywords on same line(s) as the types

## Cause

The `new` keyword and the type name are placed on different lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when object creations are placed on the same lines.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Object creation is a common operation in object-oriented programming, and the `new` keyword with the type name forms a single logical unit.
When these elements are split across lines, it becomes harder to understand what type of object is being created.

Placing `new` keywords on the same lines as the types provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete object creation expression is visible at a glance.
  Developers can immediately see what type of object is being instantiated without scanning multiple lines.

- **Clearer Type Information**:
  Keeping the `new` keyword and type name together makes it easy to identify what types are being created in the code.
  This is important for understanding object lifetimes and dependencies.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When object creation fits on one line, it can be processed as a single unit of information.
  Developers do not need to mentally combine the `new` keyword with the type from different lines.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Object creation expressions read naturally when the `new` keyword and type are together.
  This follows the standard C# syntax pattern that developers expect to see.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  When searching for object instantiations or specific type creations, having them on single lines makes them easier to locate.
  Developers can use text search more effectively.

- **Better Code Review**:
  Compact object creation expressions are easier to review during code reviews.
  Reviewers can quickly verify that the correct type is being instantiated with the appropriate constructor arguments.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the type name to the same line as the `new` keyword.
Ensure that the object creation expression is compact and reads naturally.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6042
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6042
```
