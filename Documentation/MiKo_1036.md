# MiKo_1036: Do not use `Model` marker in events dealing with entities

## Cause

An event name includes `Model` when dealing with entity types.

## Rule description

Using `Model` in an event name to show it deals with an entity is unnecessary.
Just name the event clearly without `Model`.

Event names should directly represent what happened or what will happen, not include design pattern terminology or implementation details.

### Rationale behind

Including `Model` in event names creates unnecessary verbosity that obscures the event's purpose.
Event names should clearly communicate what happened or what is about to happen, and the `Model` suffix adds noise without conveying useful information.

The event's signature already indicates what types are involved, so adding `Model` to the name duplicates information.
Clean, action-focused event names improve code readability and make the event's purpose immediately clear.

Removing `Model` from event names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Event names like `UserChanged` or `UserDeleted` immediately convey what happened.
  `UserModelChanged` or `UserModelDeleted` obscure the action with technical terminology.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The event's signature shows what types are involved.
  Adding `Model` to the name repeats this information unnecessarily.

- **More Natural Code**:
  Event handlers work more naturally with clear event names.
  `OnUserChanged` reads better than `OnUserModelChanged`.

- **Better Business Alignment**:
  Event names should reflect business events, not technical implementation details.
  `UserChanged` aligns with how business stakeholders describe the event.

- **Consistency with Conventions**:
  Standard C# event naming conventions focus on the action, not the technical classification of involved types.
  Following this convention makes code more familiar to other developers.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  If architectural changes mean entities are no longer called "models", event names do not need updating.
  Action-focused names remain stable over time.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Event names should communicate what happened in the system, not technical details about data structures.
  Focus on the event itself rather than implementation specifics.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the event to remove the `Model` marker, using a name that describes what happened or what will happen.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1036
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1036
```
