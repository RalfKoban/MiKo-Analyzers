# MiKo_1001: Name `System.EventArgs` parameters `e`

## Cause

A parameter that inherits from `System.EventArgs` is not named `e`.

## Rule description

To maintain consistency and clarity in code, parameters that inherit from `System.EventArgs` should be named `e`.

This naming convention follows the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for event handlers.
Using a consistent name makes event handler code more predictable and easier to read.

The standard pattern for event handlers in .NET is to have two parameters: `object sender` and an `EventArgs` parameter named `e`.
This convention is used throughout the .NET Framework and should be followed in code.

### Rationale behind

Naming `EventArgs` parameters `e` is a deeply ingrained .NET convention that creates instant familiarity and consistency across all event handlers.
This pattern appears in every event handler throughout the .NET Framework, from Windows Forms to WPF to ASP.NET, making it one of the most universally recognized conventions in .NET development.

When developers see an event handler signature, the expectation is `(object sender, SomeEventArgs e)`, and deviating from this causes unnecessary cognitive friction.
This single-letter name is appropriate because event handlers follow a highly standardized signature pattern.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Universal Recognition**:
  The `e` parameter name is instantly recognized by all .NET developers.
  This familiarity eliminates any confusion about which parameter contains the event data.

- **Concise Yet Clear**:
  The brevity of `e` keeps event handler signatures short and readable.
  Within the event handling context, this single letter is completely unambiguous and does not sacrifice clarity.

- **Consistency Across Platforms**:
  Every .NET framework and library uses this convention.
  Following it makes custom event handlers feel integrated with the platform.

- **Improved Code Transferability**:
  When developers move between projects or teams, seeing the familiar `e` parameter immediately signals standard event handler behavior.
  This makes it easier to copy, adapt, and understand event handling code across different codebases.

- **Easier Learning**:
  New .NET developers learn this pattern once and can apply it everywhere.
  Deviating from this convention forces developers to learn project-specific variations unnecessarily.

- **Better Code Examples**:
  When sharing code snippets or examples, using `e` ensures that other developers can immediately understand the code without needing additional explanation.
  This uniformity reduces errors and speeds up development.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `EventArgs` parameter to `e`.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_1001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1001
