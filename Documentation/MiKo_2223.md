# MiKo_2223: Link references via `<see cref="..."/>` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains plain text references to methods, types, or other code elements instead of using `<see cref="..."/>` tags.

## Rule description

XML documentation should link references like methods or types using `<see cref="..."/>` instead of plain text.
This approach ensures refactoring tools can update these references during renames, preventing the documentation from pointing to non-existent code.

### Rationale behind

Plain text references in documentation become outdated quickly when code is refactored.
When methods or types are renamed, plain text references break silently, leading to misleading or incorrect documentation.

Using `<see cref="..."/>` tags provides several important benefits:

- **Automatic Refactoring Support**:
  When code elements are renamed using IDE refactoring tools, references in `<see cref="..."/>` tags are automatically updated.
  This keeps documentation synchronized with the code without manual intervention.

- **Compile-Time Validation**:
  The compiler verifies that `<see cref="..."/>` references point to valid code elements.
  If a reference is incorrect or becomes invalid, the compiler generates a warning, alerting developers to fix the documentation.

- **Enhanced Navigation**:
  IDEs provide click-through navigation from `<see cref="..."/>` tags to the referenced code elements.
  This makes it easy for developers to explore related code directly from the documentation.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When documentation appears in IntelliSense tooltips, `<see cref="..."/>` references are rendered as hyperlinks.
  This provides a better user experience and makes documentation more interactive.

- **Prevents Documentation Rot**:
  Documentation that uses plain text references quickly becomes stale and unreliable as code evolves.
  Using `<see cref="..."/>` ensures documentation stays accurate over time.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Properly linked documentation demonstrates attention to detail and commitment to maintaining high-quality code and documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace plain text references to methods, types, or other code elements with `<see cref="..."/>` tags in the documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2223
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2223
```
