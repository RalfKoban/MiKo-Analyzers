# MiKo_6059: Position multi-line conditions outdented below associated calls

## Cause

Multi-line conditions are not outdented below the associated calls.

## Rule description

Outdent multi-line conditions below the corresponding call to make them easier to read.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Outdenting multi-line conditions is crucial for maintaining clear visual separation between method calls and their conditional logic.
When conditions are outdented rather than indented, they stand out from the method call itself, making the code structure more apparent and preventing the condition from being visually merged with the method parameters.

Outdenting multi-line conditions below associated calls provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Distinction**:
  Outdenting creates a clear visual boundary between the method call and the condition that controls it.
  This makes it immediately obvious that the following lines are part of a conditional expression rather than method arguments.

- **Improved Code Scanning**:
  When conditions are outdented, developers can quickly scan through code to find conditional logic.
  The outdented position acts as a visual marker that draws attention to important decision points in the code.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Proper outdentation prevents conditions from being mistaken for method parameters or other parts of the call.
  This reduces cognitive load and helps developers understand the code structure at a glance.

- **Better Readability**:
  Outdented conditions are easier to read because they are not buried within deeply nested indentation.
  This makes complex conditional logic more accessible and understandable.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When debugging, outdented conditions are easier to locate and evaluate.
  Developers can quickly find the conditional logic without having to trace through multiple indentation levels.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Clear separation between calls and conditions makes it easier to modify either part independently.
  Future changes are less likely to introduce formatting issues or misunderstandings.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, outdent the multi-line conditions below the associated calls.
Position the condition at a lower indentation level than the method call to create clear visual separation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6059
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6059
```
