# MiKo_1095: Do not use `Delete` and `Remove` both in names and documentation

## Cause

The name and documentation use both `Delete` and `Remove` inconsistently.

## Rule description

While `Delete` and `Remove` seem similar, there is a key difference:
- `Delete` means to erase something, making it nonexistent and nonrecoverable.
- `Remove` means to take something away and set it aside, but it still exists.

So, do not mix these terms in documentation and naming.

For instance, do not name a method `RemoveUser` if the documentation states it *"Deletes the user from the database."*

### Rationale behind

Inconsistency between method names and their documentation creates confusion about what a method actually does.
When a method is named `RemoveUser` but documented as deleting the user, developers cannot be sure whether the user is permanently erased or just removed from a collection.
This ambiguity can lead to incorrect usage and bugs, especially in scenarios involving data persistence or resource management.

Using consistent terminology provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Consistent use of `Delete` or `Remove` makes it immediately clear what happens to the data.
  Developers can trust that the name accurately reflects the behavior without needing to read the implementation.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When names and documentation match, future maintainers can understand the code more quickly.
  They do not need to reconcile conflicting information or guess the true behavior.

- **Reduced Risk of Errors**:
  Clear, consistent naming helps prevent misuse of methods.
  When developers know exactly what a method does based on its name, they are less likely to use it incorrectly.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  Reviewers can more easily verify that methods are being used correctly when the names accurately reflect their behavior.
  Inconsistencies become obvious red flags during review.

- **Better Documentation Quality**:
  Forcing consistency between names and documentation encourages developers to think carefully about what their methods do.
  This leads to better design decisions and clearer API boundaries.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure consistency between the method name and its documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1095
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1095
