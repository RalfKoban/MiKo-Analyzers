# MiKo_3503: Do not assign variables in try-catch blocks that are returned directly outside

## Cause

A variable is declared outside a try-catch block, assigned within the try block, and then returned immediately after the try-catch block.

## Rule description

Avoid defining variables outside of try/catch blocks, assigning them within the try/catch block, and then returning them immediately after leaving the block.
Instead, return the variables directly from within the try/catch block.
This makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Declaring variables outside try-catch blocks when they are only used to return values adds unnecessary complexity.
The variable serves no purpose other than to bridge the gap between the try-catch block and the return statement.

Returning directly from try-catch blocks provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Returning directly from within the block makes the code flow clearer.
  Developers can immediately see what value is returned in each case.

- **Reduced Scope**:
  Moving variable declarations inside the try block reduces variable scope.
  This makes it easier to understand where and how variables are used.

- **Better Code Clarity**:
  Direct returns make the control flow more obvious.
  There is no ambiguity about what happens in each execution path.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code without unnecessary variables is easier to modify and refactor.
  There are fewer moving parts to keep track of.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Fewer variables with broader scope mean less cognitive load when reading the code.
  Developers do not need to track variable state across block boundaries.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Direct returns communicate that each block produces its own result.
  The code's purpose is more immediately obvious.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the variable declaration and return statement inside the try-catch blocks.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3503
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3503
```
