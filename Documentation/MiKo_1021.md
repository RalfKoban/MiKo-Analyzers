# MiKo_1021: Limit method name length

## Cause

A method name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long method names can indicate poor abstraction or attempting to encode too much information in the name.
They make code harder to scan and understand at a glance.

### Rationale behind

Limiting method name length is essential for creating readable, maintainable code.
Overly long method names create visual noise and make code harder to scan efficiently.
When method names are excessively long, they can cause code to wrap awkwardly, make method chains difficult to read, and obscure the overall structure of the code.

Long method names often signal that a method is doing too much or that the name is trying to describe implementation details rather than the method's primary purpose.
Well-designed methods with single responsibilities typically have concise, focused names that clearly communicate what they do without requiring extensive qualifiers or descriptive phrases.

Keeping method names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter method names are easier to read and make code more scannable.
  Developers can quickly understand logic flow without getting distracted by verbose identifiers.

- **Better Productivity**:
  Concise method names are faster to type, easier to remember, and less error-prone.
  This improves developer efficiency and reduces the likelihood of naming mistakes.

- **Enhanced Code Flow**:
  When method names are appropriately short, code flows more naturally.
  Method calls, especially in chains or fluent interfaces, remain readable and do not require excessive line breaks.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Well-chosen short method names often communicate intent more clearly than verbose names.
  They focus on what the method does without trying to describe how it does it.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Methods with concise names are easier to work with when refactoring or updating code.
  Changes are more straightforward when method names are not excessively long.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When method names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what the method does.
  This makes it easier to understand the overall behavior of a class or module.

- **Design Quality Indication**:
  Concise method names usually indicate well-designed methods with single responsibilities.
  When a method name is short and clear, it often means the method has a well-defined, focused purpose.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the method name while preserving its essential meaning, possibly by using more concise verbs or removing unnecessary qualifiers.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_1021
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1021
