# MiKo_3119: Do not return only completed task in test methods

## Cause

A test method returns `Task.CompletedTask` without performing any actual asynchronous operations.

## Rule description

Test methods returning non-generic tasks are meant to test asynchronous behavior.
They should not return `Task.CompletedTask`.
If they do, simply have them return void instead.

### Rationale behind

Asynchronous test methods exist specifically to test asynchronous code behavior.
When a test only returns `Task.CompletedTask`, it is not actually testing any asynchronous operations and the async signature is misleading.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  A void return type clearly indicates the test is synchronous.
  Returning `Task.CompletedTask` suggests asynchronous behavior that does not actually exist.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Synchronous tests are simpler and easier to understand than asynchronous ones.
  Removing unnecessary async signatures reduces cognitive load.

- **Better Performance**:
  Synchronous tests execute faster because they avoid the async state machine overhead.
  There is no benefit to paying the async cost when no asynchronous work is performed.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  Developers seeing an async test method expect to find await statements and asynchronous operations.
  Tests that just return `Task.CompletedTask` violate this expectation.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Keeping test signatures as simple as possible makes them easier to maintain.
  Unnecessary async signatures add complexity that serves no purpose.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Using void for synchronous tests and Task for truly asynchronous tests creates clear, consistent patterns.
  Developers can immediately understand a test's nature from its signature.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the test method to return void instead of Task and remove the `Task.CompletedTask` return statement.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3119
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3119
```
