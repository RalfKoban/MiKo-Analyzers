# MiKo_3038: Do not use magic numbers

## Cause

Code uses numeric literals whose meaning is not immediately clear.

## Rule description

Hard-coded numbers, often called `magic` numbers, can be unclear.
To improve maintenance, avoid them.
Instead, define these numbers as constants with meaningful names.
This approach makes the code easier to read and understand, helping developers grasp the numbers' purpose and context.

### Rationale behind

Magic numbers are numeric literals that appear in code without explanation of their significance or purpose.
When developers encounter a magic number, they must either guess its meaning or search through documentation and related code.

Replacing magic numbers with named constants provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Named constants make code self-documenting.
  `if (count > MaxAllowedItems)` is immediately understandable, while `if (count > 50)` requires context to interpret.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When a value needs to change, it can be updated in one location.
  Magic numbers scattered throughout code require finding and updating every occurrence, increasing the risk of missing one.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When the same value is used in multiple places, named constants ensure consistency.
  Magic numbers can accidentally diverge when updated in some locations but not others.

- **Better Understanding**:
  Named constants convey the purpose and meaning of values.
  This helps new team members understand the code faster without needing extensive context.

- **Type Safety**:
  Constants can have appropriate types, preventing type confusion.
  Magic numbers might be interpreted as different types in different contexts.

- **Searchability**:
  Named constants can be found using IDE search features.
  Magic numbers are difficult to search for without encountering many false positives.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, extract numeric literals into named constants with descriptive names.
Place constants at an appropriate scope (class-level for widely used values, local for single-use values).
Choose names that clearly explain what the number represents.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3038
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3038
```
