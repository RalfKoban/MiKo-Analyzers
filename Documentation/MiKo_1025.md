# MiKo_1025: Limit event name length

## Cause

An event name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long event names make the code harder to read and can indicate that the event represents a concept that is too complex.

### Rationale behind

Limiting event name length is essential for creating usable, maintainable event-driven APIs.
Overly long event names create visual clutter and make event subscriptions harder to read, especially when multiple events are being subscribed to or when event handlers are attached inline.
Long event names can make code unnecessarily verbose and difficult to scan.

Excessively long event names often signal that the event is trying to convey too much information or that the name is encoding implementation details that belong in documentation.
Well-designed events have concise, focused names that clearly indicate what happened or will happen without requiring extensive qualifiers.

Keeping event names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter event names are easier to read and make event subscriptions more scannable.
  Developers can quickly understand what events are available and what they signify without processing verbose identifiers.

- **Better Code Flow**:
  Concise event names make event subscriptions more natural and fluid.
  When events are used throughout an application, shorter names keep the code compact and easier to follow.

- **Enhanced Handler Conventions**:
  Event names work better with event handler naming conventions when they are concise.
  Handler methods often follow patterns like OnEventName, and shorter event names make these patterns more practical.

- **Clearer Event Architecture**:
  When event names are appropriately short, the overall event-driven architecture is easier to understand.
  Developers can quickly grasp the flow of events without getting distracted by long names.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Events with concise names are easier to work with when refactoring or updating code.
  Changes are more straightforward when event names are not excessively long.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When event names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what events represent.
  This makes it easier to work with event-driven designs and understand system behavior.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the event name while preserving its essential meaning, using more concise terminology that accurately represents when the event occurs.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1025
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1025
```
