# MiKo_1008: Follow .NET Framework Design Guidelines for `DependencyProperty` event handler parameter names

## Cause

The parameters of a `DependencyProperty` event handler do not follow the standard naming convention.

## Rule description

To follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines, parameters of `DependencyProperty` event handlers should be named `d` and `e`.

`DependencyProperty` event handlers follow a specific pattern where:
- The first parameter represents the DependencyObject and should be named `d`
- The second parameter represents the event data and should be named `e`

This convention is used throughout WPF and helps developers immediately recognize `DependencyProperty` event handlers.

### Rationale behind

The `d` and `e` parameter naming convention for `DependencyProperty` callbacks is a WPF-specific pattern that parallels the `sender` and `e` convention used for standard events.
This pattern is used consistently throughout WPF framework code and XAML-based applications, making it a recognizable standard for anyone working with DependencyProperties.

The `d` parameter represents the DependencyObject on which the property changed, while `e` contains the event arguments with old and new values.
Using these standard names creates instant familiarity for WPF developers.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Instant Recognition**:
  When examining a `DependencyProperty` callback, the `d` and `e` parameters immediately signal the method's purpose and parameter roles.
  Developers do not need to inspect types to understand what each parameter represents.

- **WPF Pattern Consistency**:
  This convention is used throughout the WPF framework.
  Following it makes custom `DependencyProperty` code feel integrated with the platform.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  The consistent naming reduces the mental effort required to understand `DependencyProperty` callbacks across different projects and teams.
  Developers can focus on the callback logic rather than deciphering parameter meanings.

- **Clear Context Indication**:
  The brevity of these single-letter names is appropriate because the context (`DependencyProperty` callbacks) and parameter types make their roles completely clear.
  Longer names would add verbosity without improving understanding.

- **Distinction from Standard Events**:
  While both use `e` for event arguments, the `d` parameter (instead of `sender`) specifically identifies WPF dependency property callbacks.
  This helps developers understand they are working with `DependencyProperty`-specific functionality.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  When working with complex WPF controls that may have both regular events and dependency property callbacks, the naming distinction makes it easier to identify callback types.
  This clarity improves code navigation and understanding.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  During debugging, the familiar `d` and `e` parameters make it easy to identify `DependencyProperty` callbacks in the call stack.
  This speeds up troubleshooting and problem resolution.

- **XAML Development Standards**:
  Following this pattern aligns with XAML-based application development standards.
  This makes the codebase easier to understand for developers familiar with WPF conventions and best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the first parameter to `d` and the second parameter to `e`.
