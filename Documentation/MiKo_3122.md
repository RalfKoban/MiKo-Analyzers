# MiKo_3122: Limit test method parameters to 3 or fewer

## Cause

A test method has more than 3 parameters.

## Rule description

Test methods with more than 3 parameters are often combined tests and can be hard to read.
To improve readability, split these tests into separate ones.
This makes them easier to understand and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Test methods with many parameters often test too many scenarios at once, making them difficult to read and maintain.
Each parameter adds complexity and cognitive load, reducing the clarity of what the test verifies.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Tests with fewer parameters are easier to read and understand.
  Developers can quickly grasp what is being tested without tracking multiple varying inputs.

- **Clearer Test Focus**:
  Tests with many parameters often try to verify multiple scenarios in one test.
  Splitting them into focused tests makes each test's purpose obvious.

- **Better Failure Diagnosis**:
  When a test with many parameter combinations fails, it can be hard to identify which combination caused the problem.
  Simpler tests with fewer parameters make failures easier to understand.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Tests with fewer parameters are simpler to update when requirements change.
  Complex parameter combinations create maintenance burden and increase the risk of errors.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Each additional parameter multiplies the number of scenarios being tested.
  Limiting parameters helps keep tests focused and manageable.

- **More Descriptive Test Names**:
  Tests with fewer parameters can have more specific, descriptive names.
  Tests covering many parameter combinations often have generic names that hide their purpose.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, split the test method into multiple test methods, each with fewer parameters that test more specific scenarios.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3122
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3122
```
