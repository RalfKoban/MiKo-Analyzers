# MiKo_1084: Do not suffix variables with a number if their types have number suffixes

## Cause

A variable name ends with a number, and its type also has a number suffix.

## Rule description

Variable names should not repeat the number suffix from their type name.
When a type already contains a number (like `IProjectManager42`), the variable name should omit that number (use `projectManager` instead of `projectManager42`).
The type name already conveys the numeric context, so repeating it in the variable name adds no value and reduces clarity.

### Rationale behind

When both the variable name and type name contain the same number, it creates unnecessary redundancy that makes code harder to read.
For example, `projectManager42` of type `IProjectManager42` repeats the `42` information twice without adding any meaningful distinction.
The type name already indicates the version or variant, so the variable name can simply be `projectManager`.

Removing redundant number suffixes from variable names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter, cleaner variable names are easier to read and understand.
  `projectManager` is clearer than `projectManager42` when the type is already `IProjectManager42`.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The type already indicates the version, dimensionality, or variant through its number suffix.
  Repeating it in the variable name serves no purpose and just adds noise.

- **Natural Language Flow**:
  Code reads more naturally when variables have simple, direct names.
  `projectManager.OpenProject()` flows better than `projectManager42.OpenProject()`.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  If the type changes from `IProjectManager42` to `IProjectManager43`, a variable named `projectManager` does not need to be renamed.
  A variable named `projectManager42` would need updating throughout the codebase.

- **Consistent Naming**:
  Following standard naming conventions makes the codebase more predictable and easier to navigate.
  Variables should describe what they represent, not repeat type information.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The variable name should focus on its role or purpose, not duplicate implementation details already expressed in the type.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the number from the variable name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1084
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1084
```
