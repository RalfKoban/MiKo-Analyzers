# MiKo_1064: Make parameter names reflect their meaning, not their type

## Cause

A parameter name is based on its type instead of its meaning.

## Rule description

To make maintenance easier, base parameter names on their meaning, not their type.
This keeps the code more intuitive and easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Parameter names that reflect type rather than meaning force developers to infer the actual purpose from context.
This creates unnecessary cognitive load and makes the code less self-documenting.
When parameter names describe what they represent, the code becomes much easier to read and maintain.

Using meaningful parameter names provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Intent**:
  Parameter names that describe meaning immediately tell developers what the parameter represents.
  There is no need to look at surrounding code to understand the purpose.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Good parameter names reduce the need for comments explaining what each parameter is for.
  The method signature itself becomes documentation.

- **Better Refactoring**:
  When parameter types change, meaningful names remain valid.
  Type-based names become misleading and require renaming when types evolve.

- **Improved IntelliSense**:
  When calling a method, IntelliSense displays parameter names.
  Meaningful names help developers pass the correct arguments without checking documentation.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can understand what the method does more quickly when parameters have descriptive names.
  This leads to faster, more effective reviews.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When parameters have clear, distinct names, developers are less likely to pass arguments in the wrong order.
  Type-based names like 'stringValue1` and 'stringValue2` are easy to confuse.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to reflect what it represents, not what type it is.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1064
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1064
```
