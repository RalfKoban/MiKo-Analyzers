# MiKo_3089: Do not use simple constant property patterns as conditions in `if` statements

## Cause

An `if` statement uses a property pattern with a simple constant value instead of a normal condition.

## Rule description

Normal conditions are easier to understand than property pattern conditions with constants.
Therefore, convert these property conditions into normal ones.
This approach keeps the code clear and readable.

### Rationale behind

Property patterns are a powerful feature for complex scenarios like destructuring and matching multiple properties.
However, when used for simple constant checks, they add unnecessary complexity without providing any benefit.

Using normal conditions for simple property checks provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Code Clarity**:
  A normal condition like `person.Age == 18` is immediately obvious to all C# developers.
  The property pattern equivalent `person is { Age: 18 }` requires more syntax and mental parsing for the same simple check.

- **Reduces Learning Curve**:
  Normal comparison syntax is fundamental C# that all developers know.
  Property patterns are a more advanced feature that not all developers are familiar with, especially those new to modern C# versions.

- **Simplifies Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can scan through normal conditions very quickly.
  Property patterns require more careful reading to ensure the pattern is correct and matches the intent.

- **Maintains Appropriate Feature Usage**:
  Property patterns shine when checking multiple properties, combining with type checks, or destructuring values.
  Using them for single constant checks is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

- **Improves Consistency**:
  Most codebases use normal conditions for simple property checks.
  Mixing in property patterns for the same simple scenarios creates inconsistency that makes the code harder to follow.

- **Enhances Performance Clarity**:
  While performance differences are minimal, normal conditions are more straightforward for the compiler and easier to reason about for developers concerned with performance.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, convert the property pattern to a normal condition.
Replace `object is { Property: constant }` with `object.Property == constant`.
For multiple simple property checks, use normal conditions combined with logical operators instead of complex property patterns.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3089
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3089
```
