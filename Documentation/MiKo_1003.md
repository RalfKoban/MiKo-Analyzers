# MiKo_1003: Follow .NET Framework Design Guidelines for event handling method names

## Cause

An event handler method does not follow the [.NET Framework naming conventions for event handlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/).

## Rule description

Event handlers should be named starting with `On` followed by the event name to show they handle events.

This naming convention follows the .NET Framework Design Guidelines and makes it immediately clear that a method is an event handler.
Using a consistent naming pattern helps developers understand the code structure and find event handlers quickly.

For example, if handling a `Click` event, the event handler method should be named something like `OnButtonClick` or `OnClick`.

### Rationale behind

Following the `On` prefix convention for event handlers is essential for creating self-documenting, maintainable code.
This pattern is deeply ingrained in .NET development and immediately signals to any developer that a method responds to an event.

The consistency this provides is invaluable when navigating large codebases, as developers can quickly identify all event handlers by scanning for the `On` prefix.
This convention also distinguishes event handlers from other methods, reducing confusion about a method's purpose.

Using the `On` prefix provides several important benefits:

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  The `On` prefix immediately communicates that a method is event-driven rather than explicitly called by other code.
  This distinction is important for understanding program flow and dependencies.

- **Natural Language Flow**:
  The prefix reads naturally in English (e.g., `OnButtonClick` means "when the button is clicked").
  This makes code more intuitive and easier to understand.

- **Quick Identification**:
  Developers can quickly locate all event handlers in a file or project by scanning for the `On` prefix.
  This speeds up code navigation and understanding.

- **Clear Method Purpose**:
  The naming immediately distinguishes event handlers from business logic methods, helper methods, and other code.
  This clarity reduces confusion and improves code organization.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The pattern is used throughout the .NET Framework base class library, WPF, Windows Forms, and ASP.NET.
  Following it makes custom code feel integrated with platform conventions.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  During code reviews, the `On` prefix makes it immediately clear which methods are triggered by events.
  This helps reviewers understand the code flow and verify correct event handling.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Adhering to this standard makes code more accessible and professional.
  It signals that the code follows established best practices and design guidelines.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the event handler method to start with `On`.
