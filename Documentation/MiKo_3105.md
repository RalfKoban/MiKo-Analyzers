# MiKo_3105: Use NUnit's fluent Assert approach in test methods

## Cause

A test method uses NUnit's classic assertion methods such as `Assert.AreEqual`, `Assert.IsTrue`, or `Assert.IsNotNull`.

## Rule description

NUnit's constraint-based Assert model uses a single `Assert.That` method for all assertions, making it easier to understand.
This helps developers avoid mixing up `actual` and `expected` values and makes the code more readable and intuitive.

### Rationale behind

NUnit's fluent assertion syntax provides a more consistent and readable approach to writing test assertions.
The [constraint model](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/assertions/assertion-models/constraint.html) uses natural language constructs that make test intentions clearer and reduce common mistakes.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Parameter Confusion**:
  Classic assertions like `Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual)` are easy to get backwards.
  The fluent syntax `Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))` makes the roles of each value explicit.

- **Improved Readability**:
  The fluent syntax reads like natural language, making assertions easier to understand.
  Constructs like `Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null)` are self-explanatory.

- **Consistent Syntax**:
  Using `Assert.That` for all assertions creates consistency across the test suite.
  Developers do not need to remember different method names for different assertion types.

- **Better Error Messages**:
  Constraint-based assertions often produce more informative error messages.
  The assertion framework can provide better context about what was expected versus what was received.

- **More Expressive Assertions**:
  The constraint model offers a rich set of composable constraints that make complex assertions clearer.
  Combinations like `Is.Not.Null.And.EqualTo(expected)` are easy to express and understand.

- **Easier to Learn**:
  New developers can learn one assertion pattern that works for all scenarios.
  There is no need to memorize multiple assertion methods with different parameter orders.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace classic assertion methods with `Assert.That` and the appropriate constraint.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3105
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3105
```
