# MiKo_1522: Do not start void methods with 'Get'

## Cause

A method returns `void` but starts with 'Get'.

## Rule description

Methods that return `void` should not start with 'Get' because they do not return anything.
The word 'Get' suggests a value will be retrieved, which can confuse readers.

Use verbs like 'Load', 'Collect', or 'Populate' for methods that perform actions instead.
This makes code clearer and follows common .NET naming conventions.

### Rationale behind

Methods that start with 'Get' create an expectation that a value is being retrieved and returned.
When a method returns `void`, it violates this expectation and can mislead developers who read the code.
This inconsistency makes the codebase harder to understand and maintain.

Using appropriate action verbs for `void` methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Code Clarity**:
  Action verbs like 'Load', 'Collect', or 'Populate' clearly indicate that the method performs an operation without returning a value.
  Developers can immediately understand the method's purpose without having to examine its signature.

- **Better Intent Communication**:
  The method name accurately reflects what the method does.
  Names like 'LoadData' or 'PopulateCache' communicate that the method modifies state or performs side effects rather than calculating and returning a result.

- **Consistency with .NET Conventions**:
  The .NET Framework consistently uses 'Get' prefix for methods that return values.
  Following this convention makes code more predictable and easier for other developers to work with.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  When all 'Get' methods return values, developers can quickly identify which methods are queries (return values) and which are commands (perform actions).
  This distinction helps prevent misunderstandings about method behavior.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly spot potential issues when a method name does not match its return type.
  This makes code reviews more efficient and helps maintain code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to use an appropriate action verb instead of 'Get'.

Consider what the method actually does and choose a verb that accurately describes that action.
Common alternatives include 'Load', 'Collect', 'Populate', 'Fill' or 'Update'.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1522
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1522
```
