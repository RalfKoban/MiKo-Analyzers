# MiKo_1098: Reflect implemented business interface(s) in type names

## Cause

A type implements a business interface but the type name does not reflect this.

## Rule description

When a type implements a business interface, its name should reflect that.
This makes it easier for developers to identify and use the type.
For instance, if a type implements the `IPart` interface, it should be named something like `XyzPart`.

### Rationale behind

When types implement business interfaces but do not reflect this in their names, it becomes difficult to understand what a type is intended to represent.
Business interfaces define important domain concepts (like `IPart`, `ICustomer`, `IOrder`), and types implementing these interfaces should clearly indicate which concept they represent.
Without this naming convention, developers must examine the full type declaration or documentation to understand the type's role in the domain model.

Reflecting business interfaces in type names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  When type names include the interface concept, developers can easily find all implementations of a particular business concept.
  Searching for `Part` will reveal all types that represent parts in the system.

- **Better Code Clarity**:
  Type names that reflect their business purpose make code self-documenting.
  Developers can understand what a type represents just by looking at its name, without needing to check its interface implementations.

- **Enhanced Domain Understanding**:
  Clear naming helps developers understand the domain model and how different types relate to business concepts.
  This is especially important for new team members who are learning the codebase.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that types are being used correctly when the names clearly indicate their business purpose.
  It is easier to spot when a type is being used in an inappropriate context.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When types are named according to the business concepts they implement, it is easier to maintain consistency across the codebase.
  Changes to the domain model can be tracked more easily when names align with business terminology.

- **Clearer Architecture**:
  Consistent naming of business types makes the overall architecture more apparent.
  Developers can better understand how the system is organized and where different responsibilities lie.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the interface name (without the `I` prefix) as a suffix to the type name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1098
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1098
```
