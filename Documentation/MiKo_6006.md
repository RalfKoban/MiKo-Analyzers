# MiKo_6006: Surround awaited statements with blank lines

## Cause

Awaited statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround awaited statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding awaited statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code structure in asynchronous code.
Await operations represent asynchronous points where control may be yielded, and visually separating them helps developers understand where asynchronous operations occur and how they fit into the overall program flow.

Surrounding awaited statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Asynchronous Operation Visibility**:
  Blank lines make await operations stand out as important asynchronous points.
  Developers can immediately identify where the code may yield control and resume execution later.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When await statements are visually separated, asynchronous code is easier to read and understand.
  The blank lines signal transitions between synchronous and asynchronous operations.

- **Better Understanding of Control Flow**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand where execution may be interrupted.
  This is crucial for reasoning about the behavior of asynchronous code.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  Visually distinct await statements are easier to locate when debugging asynchronous operations.
  Developers can quickly find await points to verify execution order or identify timing issues.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  During code reviews, separated await statements are easier to identify and verify.
  Reviewers can quickly check that asynchronous operations are being handled correctly.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When await statements are clearly separated, modifying asynchronous code is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where asynchronous operations occur.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after awaited statements.
Ensure each await operation is visually separated from the surrounding synchronous code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6006
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6006
```
