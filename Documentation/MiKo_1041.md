# MiKo_1041: Do not suffix fields with implementation details

## Cause

A field name ends with an implementation detail suffix like `List`.

## Rule description

Adding suffixes like `List` to field names adds unnecessary clutter.
It is best to avoid them for cleaner, more readable code.

Field names should describe what they represent from a conceptual standpoint, not how they are implemented.
The field type already provides implementation information.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing field names with implementation details like `List`, `Array`, or `Dictionary` clutters the code and makes it harder to read.
The type system already provides this information, so repeating it in the name is redundant.

Avoiding implementation detail suffixes in field names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Field names without type suffixes are cleaner and easier to read.
  Developers can focus on what the field represents rather than how it is stored.

- **Better Abstraction**:
  Names that describe the concept rather than the implementation make the code more flexible.
  If the implementation changes from a List to an IEnumerable, the name does not need to change.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to process redundant information when reading the code.
  The field type is already visible in the declaration, so the name can focus on the semantic meaning.

- **Consistency with .NET Standards**:
  The .NET Framework and most C# codebases avoid type suffixes in field names.
  Following this convention makes the code more familiar to other developers.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Field names that describe what they represent (like `items` or `users`) are more meaningful than names that describe how they are stored (like `itemList` or `userArray`).

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  When field names are not tied to their implementation, changing the underlying type does not require renaming the field throughout the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field to remove the implementation detail suffix.
Use a plural form or a more descriptive name that represents what the field contains conceptually.

For example, rename `itemList` to `items`, or `userArray` to `users`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1041
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1041
```
