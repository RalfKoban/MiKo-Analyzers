# MiKo_3088: Use pattern matching for not-null checks

## Cause

A condition uses the inequality operator (`!=`) to check if a value is not null instead of pattern matching.

## Rule description

Null checks using `is not` pattern matching are more intuitive and easier to read than the `!=` inequality operator.
This makes them the preferred choice for clarity and comprehension.

### Rationale behind

Checking for non-null values is one of the most common operations in C# code.
Using modern pattern matching syntax for these checks makes the code more readable and aligns with current C# best practices.

Using pattern matching for not-null checks provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Readability**:
  The pattern `value is not null` reads more naturally in English than `value != null`.
  It clearly expresses the intent of checking for a non-null value in a more fluent and explicit way.

- **Prevents Operator Overload Issues**:
  Some types overload the `!=` operator in ways that can cause unexpected behavior with null checks.
  Pattern matching always performs a true null check regardless of operator overloads.

- **Maintains Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching for null checks creates consistency with other pattern matching usage like type checks and constant checks.
  This leads to a more uniform coding style throughout the codebase.

- **Supports Language Evolution**:
  Pattern matching is the direction C# is moving for all kinds of comparisons.
  Using it for not-null checks prepares the code for future language features and patterns.

- **Simplifies Combined Checks**:
  Pattern matching can be easily combined with type checks in a single expression.
  For example, `value is not null and string` is clearer than combining separate null and type checks.

- **Follows Framework Guidelines**:
  Microsoft's coding guidelines and the .NET runtime code itself increasingly use pattern matching for null checks.
  Following this convention aligns code with the broader .NET ecosystem.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `value != null` with `value is not null`.
This applies to all reference types and nullable value types where a not-null check is performed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3088
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3088
```
