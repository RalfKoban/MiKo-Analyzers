# MiKo_3049: Apply [Description] attribute to enum members

## Cause

An enum member does not have a `[Description]` attribute.

## Rule description

In C#, there might be a need for a string description for an enum value.
Achieve this by using the `System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute` to decorate the enum member.
This method associates descriptive text with enum values, enhancing both readability and usability.

### Rationale behind

Enum values in C# are typically represented by identifiers that follow naming conventions, which may not always be suitable for user interfaces or external representations.
The Description attribute provides a way to associate human-readable text with enum values.

Using Description attributes on enum members provides several important benefits:

- **User-Friendly Display**:
  Enum values can be displayed with proper spacing, capitalization, and formatting in user interfaces.
  Raw enum names like `DoNotProcess` can be displayed as "Do Not Process".

- **Localization Support**:
  Description strings can be localized without changing enum identifiers.
  This allows the same code to support multiple languages and regions.

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  Enum identifiers can follow code conventions while display text follows UI conventions.
  This keeps code maintainable without compromising the user experience.

- **Consistent Presentation**:
  The attribute provides a standard way to get display text for enum values.
  This ensures consistency across the application rather than having different formatting approaches.

- **Documentation**:
  Descriptions serve as inline documentation explaining what each enum value represents.
  This helps developers understand the purpose and meaning of enum values.

- **Tool Support**:
  Some UI frameworks and tools can automatically use Description attributes to populate dropdowns and other controls.
  This reduces boilerplate code for building user interfaces.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a `[Description]` attribute to each enum member.
Provide a clear, user-friendly description that explains what the enum value represents.
Use complete sentences or phrases that would be appropriate for display in a user interface.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3049
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3049
```
