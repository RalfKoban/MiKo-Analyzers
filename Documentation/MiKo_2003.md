# MiKo_2003: Start event handler documentation with default phrase

## Cause

The documentation for an event handler method does not start with a standard phrase explaining which event it handles.

## Rule description

Documentation for an event handler should begin with a standard phrase that explains which event it handles.

### Rationale behind

Event handler methods respond to specific events, and their documentation should clearly indicate this relationship.
When event handlers follow a consistent documentation pattern, developers can immediately understand the method's purpose and the event it responds to.

Using standard phrasing for event handler documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Purpose Identification**:
  Developers can instantly recognize that a method is an event handler rather than a regular method.
  This saves time when navigating through code and trying to understand the application flow.

- **Event-Handler Connection**:
  The documentation explicitly states which event triggers the handler.
  This makes it easy to trace the flow of events through the application without searching through event subscription code.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework uses consistent patterns for event handler documentation.
  Following the same approach creates a familiar experience for developers who work with standard .NET events.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Standard phrasing eliminates confusion about whether a method is an event handler or performs some other function.
  The intent is clear from the documentation alone.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When event handlers are consistently documented, it becomes easier to review and update event-handling code.
  Developers can quickly identify all handlers for a particular event.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  New team members can understand the event-driven architecture of the application more quickly when handlers are clearly identified.
  This accelerates onboarding and reduces the learning curve.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the event handler documentation to start with a standard phrase.

Use a phrase like `Handles the <see cref="EventName" /> event.` or `Called when the <see cref="EventName" /> event occurs.` to clearly indicate which event the method handles.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2003
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2003
```
