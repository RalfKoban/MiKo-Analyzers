# MiKo_1032: Do not use `Model` as marker in methods dealing with entities

## Cause

A method name includes `Model` when dealing with entity types.

## Rule description

Using `Model` in a method name to indicate it deals with an entity is unnecessary.
Just name the method clearly without using `Model`.

The presence of `Model` in method names adds clutter without providing meaningful information.
The method signature and context already make it clear what types are being used.

### Rationale behind

Including `Model` in method names that work with entities creates unnecessary verbosity and violates the DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle.
The method's parameter types and return types already explicitly indicate what entities are being manipulated, making the `Model` marker in the name redundant.

When methods are named clearly and concisely (for example, `SaveUser` instead of `SaveUserModel`), the code becomes more scannable and easier to understand.
Clean method names that focus on actions and domain concepts rather than technical terminology make the codebase more aligned with business language and improve communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Removing `Model` from method names provides several important benefits:

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The method signature already shows what types are being used.
  Including `Model` in the name repeats information that is already visible.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter method names are easier to scan and understand.
  `SaveUser` is clearer and more direct than `SaveUserModel`.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  If the architecture is refactored and entities are no longer called "models", all method names would need updating.
  Generic, action-focused names avoid this maintenance burden.

- **Cleaner Code**:
  Method names that focus on what action is being performed rather than technical details create more professional, well-designed code.

- **Enhanced Business Alignment**:
  Business stakeholders understand `SaveUser` immediately.
  `SaveUserModel` introduces technical jargon that obscures the business meaning.

- **Consistency**:
  When method names focus on actions rather than implementation details, naming patterns become more predictable and easier to follow across the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to remove the `Model` marker, focusing on the action being performed rather than technical terminology.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1032
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1032
