# MiKo_2233: Place XML tags on single line

## Cause

XML documentation tags span multiple lines when they should be on a single line.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when XML tags span a single line.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

XML tags that span multiple lines unnecessarily add vertical space to code files and make them harder to scan.
When tags can be placed on a single line, doing so improves the overall structure and readability of the documentation.

Placing XML tags on single lines provides several important benefits:

- **Reduced Vertical Space**:
  Single-line tags take up less vertical space in code files.
  This allows developers to see more code and documentation on screen at once, improving overview.

- **Easier Scanning**:
  When tags are compact and on single lines, developers can quickly scan through documentation structure without being distracted by unnecessary line breaks.
  This makes navigation faster.

- **Clearer Structure**:
  Single-line tags make the hierarchy and organization of documentation more immediately visible.
  The structure stands out more clearly.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  Following a standard format where appropriate tags are on single lines creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes documentation more predictable and easier to work with.

- **Better Code Diffs**:
  In version control, single-line tags create cleaner diffs when documentation changes.
  It is easier to see what content changed without being distracted by reformatted tags.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Well-formatted documentation with appropriate use of single-line tags appears more polished and demonstrates attention to detail.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place XML tags that do not require multiple lines onto a single line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2233
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2233
```
