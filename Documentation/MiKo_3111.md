# MiKo_3111: Use `Is.Zero` instead of `Is.EqualTo(0)` in assertions

## Cause

A test method uses `Is.EqualTo(0)` instead of `Is.Zero` in an assertion.

## Rule description

To improve clarity, use `Is.Zero` instead of `Is.EqualTo(0)` when asserting for zero in tests.
This makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Using specialized constraints like `Is.Zero` makes test assertions more expressive and readable.
The intent of the assertion becomes immediately clear without requiring mental translation of numeric literals.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  `Is.Zero` is more expressive and immediately communicates the intent.
  Developers can read and understand the assertion faster than with `Is.EqualTo(0)`.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Specialized constraints eliminate the need to mentally process numeric values.
  The assertion reads more like natural language.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Using built-in constraints for common cases creates consistency across the test suite.
  All tests checking for zero use the same clear pattern.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  `Is.Zero` is self-explanatory and requires no additional context or comments.
  The assertion's purpose is obvious even to developers unfamiliar with the test.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Specialized constraints highlight that zero is a significant value being tested.
  Generic equality checks do not emphasize the importance of the specific value.

- **Aligns with Framework Design**:
  NUnit provides `Is.Zero` specifically for this common case.
  Using it follows the framework's conventions and best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `Is.EqualTo(0)` with `Is.Zero` in assertions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3111
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3111
```
