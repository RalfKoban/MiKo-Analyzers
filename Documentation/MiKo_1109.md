# MiKo_1109: Prefix testable types with `Testable` instead of using the `Ut` suffix

## Cause

A type name ends with `Ut` (unit test) instead of being prefixed with `Testable`.

## Rule description

When creating testable versions of types for testing purposes, prefix them with `Testable` rather than using the `Ut` suffix.
This makes the intent clearer and follows a more readable naming convention.

### Rationale behind

Using the `Testable` prefix instead of the `Ut` suffix is important for code clarity and maintainability.

Prefixing testable types with `Testable` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The prefix `Testable` clearly communicates the purpose of the class at the beginning of the name where developers naturally start reading.
  This makes the code easier to scan and understand.

- **Natural Language Flow**:
  `TestableUserService` reads more naturally than `UserServiceUt` because it follows the pattern of adjective-noun, which is common in English.
  This makes the code feel more intuitive.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The word `Testable` explicitly states that this is a version of the class designed specifically to support testing, making the purpose immediately obvious even to developers unfamiliar with the `Ut` abbreviation.

- **Consistent with Other Patterns**:
  Many .NET testing patterns use prefixes rather than suffixes, so this convention aligns better with established practices.

- **Better Alphabetical Organization**:
  When files are sorted alphabetically, testable classes with the `Testable` prefix group together, making them easier to find and manage.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Abbreviations like `Ut` can be unclear to new team members or developers from other backgrounds, while `Testable` is self-explanatory.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to use the `Testable` prefix instead of the `Ut` suffix.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1109
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1109
```
