# MiKo_3026: Remove unused parameters

## Cause

A method has parameters that are not used within the method body.

## Rule description

Unused parameters clutter the codebase and provide no benefit.
They should be removed to keep the code clean and efficient.
This ensures the code remains easy to read and maintain, enhancing overall quality and performance.
Keeps everything lean and purposeful.

### Rationale behind

Unused parameters add noise to method signatures without serving any purpose.
They confuse developers about what inputs a method actually needs and can obscure the method's true interface.

Removing unused parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Code Clarity**:
  Method signatures that only include necessary parameters communicate the method's requirements clearly.
  Unused parameters create confusion about what the method actually uses.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When refactoring code, unused parameters must be considered even though they serve no purpose.
  Removing them simplifies maintenance work.

- **Better API Design**:
  Clean method signatures make the API easier to understand and use.
  Developers know exactly what information needs to be provided.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Fewer parameters mean less information to process when reading the code.
  This makes the method easier to comprehend at a glance.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Method signatures reveal the method's dependencies.
  Unused parameters suggest dependencies that do not actually exist.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the unused parameter from the method signature.
If the method is implementing an interface or overriding a base method, consider whether the interface or base class needs refactoring.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3026
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3026
```
