# MiKo_1100: Start test class names with the name of the type under test

## Cause

A test class name does not start with the name of the type it tests.

## Rule description

A unit test class should clearly indicate the type it tests by naming it with the type's name as a prefix, followed by `Tests`.
For example, if testing `MyXyzClass`, the test class should be named `MyXyzClassTests`.
This makes it easy to identify what is being tested.

### Rationale behind

Following this naming convention is crucial for test suite organization and maintainability.

Keeping test classes named after the types they test provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Navigation**:
  Developers can instantly navigate between production code and its tests, speeding up development and debugging.
  This pattern creates a predictable parallel structure between production and test code, reducing the time spent searching for relevant tests.

- **Clearer Test Reports**:
  Test reports and continuous integration output become more meaningful, as failures clearly indicate which component is broken.
  This makes it easier to identify and fix issues quickly.

- **Better Test Coverage Visibility**:
  When tests are well-organized by this convention, it is easier to identify gaps in test coverage and ensure all components have corresponding tests.

- **Consistent Team Standards**:
  This naming standard is widely adopted across the .NET community, making codebases immediately familiar to new team members and facilitating knowledge transfer.

- **Enhanced Tooling Support**:
  Many development tools and IDE features rely on naming conventions to provide enhanced navigation and refactoring capabilities.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test class to start with the name of the type under test.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1100
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1100
```
