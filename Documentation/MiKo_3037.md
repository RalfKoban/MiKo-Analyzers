# MiKo_3037: Do not use magic numbers for timeouts

## Cause

A timeout parameter uses a numeric literal instead of a `TimeSpan`.

## Rule description

Classes often have methods like `WaitForExit` or `WaitOne` that use an `int` parameter for timeouts.
This `magic` number makes it unclear if the value is in milliseconds, seconds, etc.
To improve readability and maintenance, avoid hard-coding these numbers.
Instead, use a `TimeSpan`, which clarifies the duration and is easier to read.

Please note:
It would be even better to use extension methods like `Minutes()` or `Days()`.
This approach allows for more natural usage, such as ` xyz.WaitForExit(5.Days()); `.

### Rationale behind

Numeric timeout values are ambiguous because different APIs use different time units.
Some methods expect milliseconds, others expect seconds, and this inconsistency leads to errors and confusion.

Using `TimeSpan` provides several important benefits:

- **Explicit Units**:
  `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)` makes it immediately clear what the timeout duration is.
  A literal like `30000` requires knowledge of whether the API expects milliseconds or seconds.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Unit confusion is a common source of bugs.
  Using milliseconds where seconds are expected (or vice versa) can cause operations to time out immediately or wait far too long.

- **Better Readability**:
  Code readers can understand timeout durations at a glance without mental conversion.
  This makes code reviews faster and more effective.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When timeout values need adjustment, the intent remains clear.
  Changing `FromMinutes(5)` to `FromMinutes(10)` is more obvious than changing `300000` to `600000`.

- **Self-Documenting**:
  The time unit is part of the code itself, eliminating the need for explanatory comments.
  This reduces documentation burden and keeps comments synchronized with code.

- **Type Safety**:
  APIs that accept `TimeSpan` cannot accidentally receive values in wrong units.
  This compile-time safety prevents an entire class of runtime errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace numeric timeout values with `TimeSpan` factory methods.
If the API requires an `int` in milliseconds, use `(int)TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30).TotalMilliseconds` to make the units explicit.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3037
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3037
```
