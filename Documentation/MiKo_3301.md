# MiKo_3301: Use lambda expression bodies instead of parenthesized lambda expression blocks for single statements

## Cause

A lambda expression uses a block body for a single statement.

## Rule description

For single-statement blocks, use lambda expressions with expression bodies instead of parenthesized ones.
This avoids the noise of parentheses, making your code cleaner and easier to read.

### Rationale behind

Lambda expressions with block bodies require braces and often a return statement, adding unnecessary syntax for simple expressions.
Expression bodies provide a more concise syntax that better expresses the lambda's purpose.

Using expression bodies for single-statement lambdas provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Expression bodies eliminate unnecessary braces and return keywords.
  The lambda's logic is more visible and easier to understand.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Shorter syntax reduces visual clutter in the code.
  Developers can focus on the logic rather than ceremonial syntax.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Expression bodies clearly communicate that the lambda returns a single value.
  The purpose is immediately obvious from the syntax.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Using expression bodies aligns with modern C# style guidelines.
  This creates consistency across the codebase.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Concise lambdas are easier to read and modify.
  There are fewer lines of code to manage.

- **Modern Syntax**:
  Expression bodies represent current C# best practices.
  Using them keeps the code aligned with language conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, convert the lambda block body to an expression body.
Remove the braces, return keyword, and semicolon, keeping only the expression.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3301
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3301
```
