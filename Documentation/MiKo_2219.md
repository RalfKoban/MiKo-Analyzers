# MiKo_2219: Do not use question or exclamation marks in documentation

## Cause

The documentation contains question marks or exclamation marks.

## Rule description

XML documentation should be clear and comprehensive for developers.
It must contain all important information in an easily readable and understandable format.

- Avoid ending texts with exclamation marks; instead, use tags like `<note type="important">` for emphasis.

- Documentation should state facts, not question them. Therefore, avoid ending sentences with question marks.

This ensures clarity and usability in the documentation, making it straightforward for developers to follow.

### Rationale behind

Documentation exists to provide definitive information about how code works and should be used.
Question marks suggest uncertainty or that the reader should answer something, which has no place in API documentation.

Exclamation marks add emotional emphasis that is inappropriate for technical documentation.
If something is important enough to emphasize, it should be marked with proper tags like `<note>` that documentation tools can format distinctly.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Maintained Authority**:
  Declarative statements establish the documentation as an authoritative source of information.

- **Proper Emphasis**:
  Using `<note>` tags for important information creates appropriate, professional emphasis.

- **Professional Tone**:
  Avoiding emotional punctuation keeps documentation formal and technical.

- **Clear Communication**:
  Factual statements are clearer and more useful than questions or exclamations.

- **Better Tool Processing**:
  Documentation tools can properly format and emphasize content marked with appropriate tags.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove question marks and exclamation marks from the documentation.
Rewrite questions as declarative statements.
Replace exclamation marks with appropriate tags like `<note type="important">` when emphasis is needed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2219
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2219
