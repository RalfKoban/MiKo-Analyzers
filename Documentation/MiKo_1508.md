# MiKo_1508: Do not suffix local variables with pattern names

## Cause

A local variable name is suffixed with a pattern name.

## Rule description

Prefer naming variables using prefixes to describe their role rather than suffixes to describe their type.
This improves code readability, avoids confusion with class names and helps developers quickly understand the purpose of the variable in context.

Using descriptive names based on purpose rather than type makes code more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Rationale

Suffixing variable names with pattern names like `Strategy`, `Factory`, or `Adapter` shifts the focus from what the variable does to how it is implemented.
This violates the principle of coding to interfaces rather than implementations and makes code harder to read.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Focus on Purpose, Not Implementation**:
  A variable named `paymentStrategy` tells you about the implementation pattern but not what it does.
  `paymentProcessor` or `paymentMethod` describes its role in the system, making the code more meaningful.

- **Reduced Confusion with Class Names**:
  When you have a class called `PaymentStrategy` and variables named `paymentStrategy`, it becomes unclear whether the variable is an instance of that class or serves a different purpose.
  Role-based names avoid this confusion.

- **Better Code Evolution**:
  If you change the implementation from a Strategy pattern to a different approach, you would have to rename all variables with `Strategy` suffixes.
  Role-based names remain valid regardless of implementation changes.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Code reads more naturally when variables describe what they do: `processor.Execute()` is clearer than `processorStrategy.Execute()`.
  The pattern suffix adds noise without adding meaning to the business logic.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  When refactoring, role-based names make it easier to understand the dependencies and relationships between components without getting distracted by implementation details.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the local variable to use a prefix that describes its role instead of a suffix that describes its type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1508
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1508
```
