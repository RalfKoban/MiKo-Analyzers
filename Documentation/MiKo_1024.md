# MiKo_1024: Limit property name length

## Cause

A property name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long property names make the code harder to read and can indicate that the property represents a concept that is too complex.

### Rationale behind

Limiting property name length is important for creating clean, maintainable APIs.
Overly long property names create visual clutter and make code harder to read, especially when properties are chained together or used extensively throughout an application.
Long property names can make expressions difficult to parse visually and can push code beyond comfortable line lengths.

Excessively long property names often indicate that the property is trying to expose too complex a concept or that the name is encoding implementation details unnecessarily.
Well-designed properties have concise, focused names that clearly indicate what they expose without requiring extensive qualifiers or descriptive phrases.

Keeping property names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter property names are easier to read and make code more scannable.
  They allow developers to quickly understand what data is being accessed without getting distracted by verbose identifiers.

- **Better Code Flow**:
  Concise property names make property access and chaining more fluid and natural.
  When properties are used in expressions or LINQ queries, shorter names keep the code compact and easier to follow.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Properties with appropriately short names are easier to work with when refactoring or updating code.
  Changes are more straightforward when property names are not excessively long.

- **Framework Compatibility**:
  Shorter property names work better with data binding, serialization frameworks, and code generation tools.
  Many frameworks have limitations or conventions that favor concise property names.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When property names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what the property represents.
  This makes it easier to understand object models and work with APIs.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Well-chosen short property names often communicate intent more clearly than verbose names.
  They focus on what matters without unnecessary qualification or description.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the property name while preserving its essential meaning, using more concise terminology that accurately represents what the property exposes.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1024
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1024
```
