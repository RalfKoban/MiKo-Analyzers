# MiKo_6004: Precede variable assignment statements with blank lines

## Cause

Variable assignments are not preceded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Precede variable assignments with blank lines to visually separate them from executing code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Preceding variable assignment statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code organization and improving readability.
Assignments often represent state changes or transitions between different logical operations, and visually separating them helps developers understand when the code is moving from one operation to another.

Preceding variable assignment statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear State Change Visibility**:
  Blank lines before assignments highlight where state changes occur in the code.
  This makes it easier to track how variables are modified throughout the execution flow.

- **Improved Code Organization**:
  Visual separation creates logical sections within the code.
  Assignments stand out as distinct operations rather than being buried in a wall of code.

- **Better Readability**:
  When assignments are preceded by blank lines, the code is easier to read and understand.
  The visual breaks help developers follow the sequence of operations.

- **Enhanced Code Flow Understanding**:
  Blank lines signal transitions between different logical steps.
  This helps developers understand how the code progresses from one operation to the next.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  Visually separated assignments are easier to locate when debugging.
  Developers can quickly find where variables are modified without scanning through dense code.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When assignments are clearly separated, modifying or adding new assignments is simpler.
  The visual structure makes it obvious where assignments belong in the code flow.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a blank line before variable assignment statements.
Ensure each assignment or group of related assignments is preceded by a blank line to separate it from other code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6004
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6004
```
