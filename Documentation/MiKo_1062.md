# MiKo_1062: Keep `Can/Has/Contains` methods, properties or fields to a few words

## Cause

A method, property, or field name starting with `Can`, `Has`, or `Contains` contains too many words.

## Rule description

Detection methods, properties, or fields like `Can`, `Has`, or `Contains` should be concise, like `HasConnection` or `ContainsKey`.

If their names are longer, it likely means they are misplaced and violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

### Rationale behind

Methods, properties, and fields that start with `Can`, `Has`, or `Contains` are meant to answer simple yes/no questions.
When their names become too long, it usually signals that they are doing too much or checking multiple things at once.
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

Keeping these names short provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Short, concise names are easier to read and understand quickly.
  Long names require more mental effort to parse and comprehend.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  When a method name becomes too long, it often indicates the method should be split into multiple smaller methods.
  This leads to better structured code.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**:
  Short names help ensure each method, property, or field has one clear purpose.
  This makes the code easier to test and maintain.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  Code with short, focused methods is easier to reorganize when requirements change.
  Each piece can be moved or modified independently.

- **Clearer Logic Flow**:
  When boolean checks are simple and concise, conditional statements become much easier to read.
  Complex logic is broken down into understandable pieces.

- **Better Testability**:
  Short, focused methods with single responsibilities are much easier to unit test.
  Each test can focus on one specific behavior.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, simplify the name or refactor the method/property/field to have a more focused purpose.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1062
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1062
```
