# MiKo_3034: Use [CallerMemberName] attribute for PropertyChanged event raisers

## Cause

A method that raises `PropertyChanging` or `PropertyChanged` events does not use the `[CallerMemberName]` attribute.

## Rule description

When raising `PropertyChanging` or `PropertyChanged` events, use the `[CallerMemberName]` attribute to automatically specify the property name.
This avoids using string arguments and ensures that the rename refactoring will update the property names correctly.
This technique prevents errors and makes the code more maintainable and robust.

### Rationale behind

The `[CallerMemberName]` attribute eliminates the need to manually specify property names when raising property change notifications.
This reduces boilerplate code and removes a common source of errors in data-binding scenarios.

Using `[CallerMemberName]` provides several important benefits:

- **Automatic Property Name Resolution**:
  The compiler automatically provides the caller's member name, eliminating manual property name specification.
  This reduces code duplication and makes property setters more concise.

- **Refactoring Safety**:
  When properties are renamed, the correct name is automatically passed to event raisers without any code changes.
  Manual property name arguments can become outdated, breaking bindings.

- **Less Boilerplate Code**:
  Property setters become shorter and more readable when they do not need to explicitly pass property names.
  This makes the codebase cleaner and easier to understand.

- **Compile-Time Verification**:
  The compiler ensures that the calling member name is correctly captured.
  There is no risk of typos or mismatched property names.

- **Consistent Pattern**:
  Using `[CallerMemberName]` establishes a consistent pattern across all properties.
  This makes the code more predictable and easier to maintain.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Copy-paste errors where property names do not match the actual property are eliminated.
  This prevents subtle bugs in data binding that are difficult to diagnose.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `[CallerMemberName]` attribute to the property name parameter of event raising methods.
Make the parameter optional by providing a default value of `null` or an empty string.
Remove explicit property name arguments from calls to these methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3034
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3034
```
