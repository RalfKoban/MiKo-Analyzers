# MiKo_1076: Suffix Prism event types with `Event`

## Cause

A Prism event type does not end with the suffix `Event`.

## Rule description

Prism event types follow the pattern defined by Prism and end their names with `Event`.

### Rationale behind

Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable applications using the Publish-Subscribe pattern for event communication.
The framework establishes a convention where event types that inherit from `PubSubEvent` should end with the `Event` suffix.

Following this naming convention helps developers immediately recognize Prism events and distinguish them from standard .NET events or other types.
It makes the pub-sub communication pattern in the application more visible and understandable.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  Following the established Prism naming pattern makes code more predictable for developers familiar with Prism applications.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  When Prism events follow a consistent naming pattern, developers can more easily find all events in the codebase and understand the application's communication flow.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `Event` suffix immediately signals that this type is used for pub-sub messaging, not for direct method calls or other purposes.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Consistent naming makes it easier to organize and categorize different types of events in the application.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Distinguishing Prism events from standard .NET events through naming prevents confusion about which event pattern is being used.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When events are clearly identified, it is easier to trace message flow and understand how different parts of the application communicate.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `Event` suffix to the Prism event type name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1076
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1076
