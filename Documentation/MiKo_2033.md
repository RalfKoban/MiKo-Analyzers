# MiKo_2033: Start String return value documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A String return value documentation does not start with a default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation of a String as return value should have a specific phrase that clearly describes what the returned string represents.

### Rationale behind

String return values can represent many different things, such as formatted text, descriptions, identifiers, or messages.
Using a consistent starting phrase helps developers quickly understand what the string contains and how it should be used.

Following a standard format for String return value documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear String Content**:
  Starting String documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear what the string contains.
  Developers can quickly understand the format and purpose of the returned string.

- **Consistent Documentation Pattern**:
  Using a standard phrase for String return values creates uniformity across the codebase.
  This consistency helps developers quickly locate and understand string-returning methods.

- **Better Understanding of Format**:
  Documenting what the string represents helps developers understand the expected format and content.
  This is crucial for properly consuming and displaying string values.

- **Reduced Misuse**:
  Clear documentation of String return values reduces the likelihood of misusing the returned value.
  Developers can see exactly what the string contains and how it should be handled.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Consistent String documentation makes it easier to maintain and update methods that return strings.
  Changes to string formats can be tracked more easily when documentation follows a predictable pattern.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the String return value documentation with a specific phrase that describes what the string represents.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the content and format of the returned string.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2033
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2033
```
