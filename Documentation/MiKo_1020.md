# MiKo_1020: Limit type name length

## Cause

A type name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long type names can be a sign of poor abstraction or trying to encode too much information in the name.
They make code harder to scan and understand at a glance.

### Rationale behind

Limiting type name length is important for maintaining readable, maintainable code.
Excessively long type names create visual clutter and make code harder to scan quickly.
When type names are too long, they can push code off the screen, force awkward line breaks, and make class diagrams or API documentation difficult to read.

Long type names often indicate that a type is trying to do too much or that the name is attempting to encode implementation details that belong in documentation rather than the identifier itself.
Well-abstracted types usually have concise, focused names that clearly describe their primary responsibility without needing excessive qualifiers.

Keeping type names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter type names are easier to read and make code more scannable.
  Developers can quickly understand class relationships and architecture without getting bogged down in verbose naming.

- **Better Productivity**:
  Concise type names are faster to type, even with IntelliSense support.
  They are also easier to remember and less prone to typos, which speeds up development.

- **Enhanced Code Flow**:
  When type names are appropriately short, code flows more naturally.
  Method signatures, variable declarations, and type instantiations remain readable and do not require excessive line breaks.

- **Clearer Documentation**:
  Class diagrams, API documentation, and generated references are much easier to read when type names are concise.
  Long type names can make documentation cluttered and difficult to navigate.

- **Better Design Indication**:
  Concise type names usually indicate well-abstracted, focused types with single responsibilities.
  When a type name is short and clear, it often means the type has a well-defined purpose.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When type names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what the type represents.
  This makes it easier to understand the overall architecture and design patterns in use.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the type name while preserving its essential meaning, possibly by using more concise synonyms or removing unnecessary qualifiers.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1020
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1020
```
