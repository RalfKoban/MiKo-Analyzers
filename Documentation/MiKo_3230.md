# MiKo_3230: Do not use `Guid` as type for identifiers

## Cause

A parameter, property, or field uses `Guid` as the type for an identifier.

## Rule description

Using `Guid` directly as an identifier type is considered a form of primitive obsession, which is generally discouraged.
Instead, define custom types (e.g., CustomerId, OrderId) to represent identifiers.
This approach improves type safety and makes it harder to accidentally mix up different kinds of IDs, since the compiler will catch mismatches between unrelated types.

### Rationale behind

Using primitive types like `Guid` for identifiers allows different kinds of identifiers to be mixed accidentally.
The compiler cannot distinguish between a CustomerId and an OrderId if both are represented as `Guid`, leading to potential bugs.

Defining custom identifier types provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Type Safety**:
  Custom types prevent accidentally passing the wrong kind of identifier to a method.
  The compiler enforces that only the correct identifier type can be used.

- **Better Code Clarity**:
  Custom types make the code's intent explicit.
  Developers immediately understand what kind of identifier is expected or being used.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Changes to how identifiers are represented can be made in one place.
  All code using the identifier type automatically reflects the change.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Type safety prevents common mistakes like swapping parameters of the same primitive type.
  These bugs are caught at compile time rather than runtime.

- **Clearer APIs**:
  Methods and constructors that accept specific identifier types are self-documenting.
  The signatures clearly communicate what each parameter represents.

- **Domain Modeling**:
  Custom identifier types better represent the domain model.
  They make the code more aligned with business concepts.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, create a custom type to represent the identifier.
Replace `Guid` parameters, properties, and fields with the custom identifier type.
Consider using a record or struct to encapsulate the `Guid` value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3230
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3230
```
