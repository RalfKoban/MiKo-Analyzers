# MiKo_6056: Place brackets of collection expressions at the same position as collection initializer braces

## Cause

The brackets of collection expressions are not positioned the same way as collection initializer braces.

## Rule description

Collection expressions are similar to collection initializers in terms of readability.
Therefore, place their open brackets in the same position as the collection initializer braces.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Collection expressions are a modern C# feature that provide a concise syntax for creating collections.
When their brackets are positioned inconsistently with traditional collection initializers, it creates confusion and makes the code harder to read.

Placing collection expression brackets at the same position as collection initializer braces provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Consistency**:
  Consistent positioning creates a uniform pattern across different collection creation styles.
  Developers can recognize collection creation immediately, whether using expressions or initializers.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  When collection expressions follow the same formatting as collection initializers, developers do not need to learn different conventions.
  This makes it easier to adopt the newer syntax without confusion.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Consistent positioning makes it easier to scan through code and identify where collections are being created.
  Developers can quickly locate collection initialization regardless of which syntax is used.

- **Clearer Code Structure**:
  The consistent positioning creates a clear visual hierarchy that shows the structure of the collection.
  This makes it easier to understand nested collections or complex initialization patterns.

- **Easier Code Maintenance**:
  When both syntaxes follow the same formatting rules, it is easier to refactor between collection expressions and initializers.
  Developers can switch between styles without disrupting the visual structure of the code.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  Familiar formatting patterns reduce cognitive load.
  Developers can read and understand collection creation code more quickly when it follows expected conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, position the brackets of collection expressions in the same way as collection initializer braces.
Ensure that the formatting is consistent across different collection creation styles.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6056
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6056
```
