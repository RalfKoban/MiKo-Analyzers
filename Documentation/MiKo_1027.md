# MiKo_1027: Limit loop variable name length

## Cause

A variable name in a loop exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Loop variables should be especially concise since they appear frequently within the loop body.
Excessively long loop variable names make loops harder to read.

### Rationale behind

Limiting loop variable name length is particularly important because loop variables are referenced repeatedly throughout the loop body.
Overly long loop variable names create unnecessary verbosity and make loop logic harder to follow.
Loop constructs should be as clear and concise as possible to facilitate quick comprehension of the iteration logic.

In many cases, loop variables benefit from being especially brief, such as single letters like i, j, k for numeric loops, or short names like item or element for foreach loops.
Their scope is limited and their purpose is immediately clear from context.
When loop variable names are excessively long, the loop body becomes cluttered and the iteration pattern becomes obscured by verbose identifiers.

Keeping loop variable names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Scannability**:
  Shorter loop variable names make loop structures more apparent and easier to scan.
  Developers can quickly understand the iteration pattern without processing long identifiers.

- **Better Loop Clarity**:
  Concise loop variable names allow developers to focus on the loop logic rather than the variable names.
  The iteration operations and conditions become the primary focus.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  When loop variables are brief, the loop body is less cluttered and easier to read.
  This makes it simpler to understand what operations are being performed on each iteration.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  Brief loop variable names enable quick understanding of what is being iterated over.
  Developers can immediately grasp the loop structure without parsing verbose names.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When loop variable names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text repeatedly as they read through the loop body.
  This makes loops easier to understand and work with.

- **Better Code Density**:
  Concise loop variable names help keep loop bodies compact and within reasonable line lengths.
  This improves the overall readability of the loop construct.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the loop variable name to something more concise while preserving clarity within the loop's context.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1027
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1027
```
