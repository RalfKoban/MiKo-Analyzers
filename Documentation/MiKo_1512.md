# MiKo_1512: Do not prefix or suffix parameters with `proxy`

## Cause

A parameter name contains `proxy` as a prefix or suffix.

## Rule description

The purpose of the Proxy Pattern is to control access to another object (e.g., for lazy loading, access control, logging), without directly exposing the real object.
However, from the developer's perspective, the proxy is used *as if* it were the real object.
Therefore, names should reflect the intended role rather than the implementation detail, avoiding prefixes or suffixes like `Proxy`.

Using implementation-agnostic names improves code clarity and maintains proper abstraction.

### Rationale behind

Parameters form the public contract of a method.
Including `proxy` in parameter names exposes internal implementation details in the method signature, which violates the principle of information hiding.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Clean API Design**:
  Method signatures like `ProcessUser(IUser userProxy)` leak implementation details to callers.
  `ProcessUser(IUser user)` provides a clean interface that does not expose how the user object is implemented.

- **Flexibility for Callers**:
  When a parameter is named `userProxy`, callers might incorrectly assume they must pass a proxy.
  A role-based name allows callers to pass either a proxy or a real object without confusion.

- **Better Documentation**:
  Auto-generated documentation and IntelliSense should describe what the parameter represents in business terms.
  `proxy` is a technical detail that does not help developers understand how to use the method.

- **Stable Method Signatures**:
  If you change the implementation to not use proxies, parameter names with `proxy` become incorrect and misleading.
  Role-based names remain accurate regardless of implementation changes.

- **Improved Code Evolution**:
  Methods should be stable and not require signature changes when internal implementation details change.
  Role-based parameter names support this stability.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to remove `proxy` from its name and use a name that reflects its intended role.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1512
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1512
```
