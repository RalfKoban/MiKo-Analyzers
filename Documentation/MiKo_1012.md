# MiKo_1012: Use `Raise` instead of `Fire` in method names

## Cause

A method name uses the term `Fire` instead of `Raise` for event-related methods.

## Rule description

The word `Fire` has negative connotations, like firing employees or guns.
It is not appropriate for events.
Instead, use `Raise` for events, as it conveys a more neutral and accurate action.

In .NET, the standard terminology for triggering an event is to "raise" it.
Using `Raise` aligns with .NET conventions and makes the code more professional and easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Using `Raise` instead of `Fire` for event-related methods is important for maintaining professional, standard-compliant .NET code.
The term `Raise` is the official terminology used throughout the .NET Framework documentation, guidelines, and base class libraries.
While `Fire` might seem synonymous, it carries unintended negative connotations (firing weapons, firing employees) that can make code feel less professional.

More importantly, `Raise` has become the established convention in the .NET ecosystem, making it the expected term that all .NET developers recognize and understand.
Using non-standard terminology like `Fire` can confuse developers who are familiar with .NET conventions, requiring them to mentally translate between different terms for the same concept.

Following this standard provides several important benefits:

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Using the official .NET terminology creates a more professional, polished codebase.
  It avoids negative connotations associated with `Fire`.

- **Consistency with Framework**:
  The .NET Framework universally uses `Raise` in documentation and guidelines.
  Following this convention aligns custom code with platform standards.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When standard terminology is used consistently, developers do not need to mentally translate between different terms.
  This makes code easier to understand and work with.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Standard terminology makes code more accessible to all .NET developers.
  New team members can immediately understand event-related code without learning project-specific vocabulary.

- **Improved Documentation**:
  Using `Raise` aligns method names with official .NET documentation and tutorials.
  This makes it easier to find relevant resources and examples.

- **Universal Recognition**:
  All .NET developers learn `Raise` as the standard term for triggering events.
  Using this terminology ensures immediate understanding across teams and organizations.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename methods using `Fire` to use `Raise` instead, or follow the `On` prefix pattern for event-raising methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1012
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1012
