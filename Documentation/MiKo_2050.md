# MiKo_2050: Follow .NET Framework conventions for exception documentation

## Cause

Exception documentation does not follow the .NET Framework guidelines.

## Rule description

Documentation for exceptions should follow the .NET Framework guidelines.
This consistency ensures that the information is clear, precise, and familiar to developers, making it easier to understand and maintain.

### Rationale behind

The .NET Framework has established conventions for documenting exceptions that developers have come to expect.
Following these conventions ensures that exception documentation is consistent, clear, and familiar, which helps developers understand when and why exceptions are thrown.

Following .NET Framework conventions for exception documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Familiar Documentation Pattern**:
  Developers are accustomed to the .NET Framework's exception documentation style.
  Using the same conventions makes exception documentation immediately understandable.

- **Clear Exception Conditions**:
  The .NET Framework conventions clearly describe the conditions under which exceptions are thrown.
  This helps developers write code that properly handles or avoids exceptions.

- **Consistent Across Codebase**:
  Following standard conventions creates consistency in how exceptions are documented throughout the codebase.
  This makes the documentation more predictable and professional.

- **Better API Understanding**:
  When exception documentation follows familiar patterns, developers can better understand the API's error handling behavior.
  This improves the overall API usability.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Clear, consistent exception documentation helps developers write better error handling code.
  They can anticipate exceptions and handle them appropriately.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Following .NET Framework conventions demonstrates adherence to best practices and industry standards.
  This makes the codebase feel more professional and well-maintained.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update exception documentation to follow the .NET Framework guidelines.
Ensure that exception conditions are clearly stated and formatted consistently with .NET Framework conventions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2050
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2050
```
