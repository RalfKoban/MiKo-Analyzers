# MiKo_3115: Include code in test methods

## Cause

A test method is empty or contains only commented-out code.

## Rule description

Empty test methods mislead developers into thinking they test something.
In reality, they do not test anything, giving a false sense of "having it tested".

Commented-out code within these methods raises questions.
If uncommented, it might cause the test to fail, indicating either a problem with the test code or an uncovered bug that needs addressing.

### Rationale behind

Empty test methods or tests with only commented code provide no value and create serious problems in the test suite.
They give a false impression of test coverage while actually testing nothing.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents False Test Coverage**:
  Empty tests make test counts and coverage metrics misleading.
  Developers might believe code is tested when it is completely unverified.

- **Eliminates Confusion**:
  Commented-out test code raises questions about why it was disabled and whether it should be enabled.
  This creates unnecessary cognitive burden and maintenance overhead.

- **Improves Code Quality**:
  Removing empty tests ensures only meaningful tests remain in the suite.
  The test project stays clean and every test provides actual value.

- **Reduces Maintenance Burden**:
  Empty tests still need to be maintained during refactoring even though they provide no benefit.
  Removing them eliminates wasted effort.

- **Encourages Proper Testing**:
  Flagging empty tests prompts developers to either implement the test properly or remove it.
  This leads to better test coverage and more reliable software.

- **Supports Team Communication**:
  Commented code without clear explanation creates ambiguity about intentions.
  Either implementing or removing the test makes the team's decisions clear.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, either implement the test with actual test code and assertions, or remove the empty test method entirely.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3115
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3115
```
