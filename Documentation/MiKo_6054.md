# MiKo_6054: Place lambda arrows on same line as the parameter(s) of the lambda

## Cause

Lambda arrows are placed on different lines than the parameters or expression bodies.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when the arrow of lambda expressions is on the same line as the parameters or their expression bodies.
Avoid splitting them over multiple lines.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Lambda expressions are a core feature of modern C# programming, heavily used in LINQ, event handlers, and functional programming patterns.
When the arrow operator is separated from the parameters or body, it breaks the natural syntax flow and makes the lambda harder to recognize and understand.

Placing lambda arrows on the same line as parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete lambda signature is visible on one line, making it immediately clear what parameters are used and what the lambda does.
  Developers can understand the lambda expression without scanning multiple lines.

- **Natural Syntax Flow**:
  Lambda expressions read naturally when the arrow is kept with the parameters or body.
  This follows the expected C# syntax pattern and makes the code more intuitive.

- **Better Recognition**:
  When the arrow is properly positioned, lambda expressions are easier to recognize in the code.
  Developers can quickly identify lambdas and understand their role in the logic.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Keeping the arrow with the parameters reduces the mental effort needed to parse lambda expressions.
  Developers do not need to mentally connect pieces from different lines.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Compact lambda signatures make it easier to scan through code and identify lambda expressions.
  This is helpful when working with LINQ queries or functional programming patterns.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  When a lambda is compact, its purpose and operation are immediately clear.
  This helps developers understand what transformation or operation is being performed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the lambda arrow to the same line as the parameters or the expression body.
Ensure that the lambda expression reads naturally and follows C# conventions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6054
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6054
```
