# MiKo_1006: Use `EventHandler<T>` with `EventArgs` named after the event

## Cause

An event does not use `EventHandler<T>` with an `EventArgs` type named appropriately after the event.

## Rule description

Events should use `EventHandler<T>`, where `T` is a class that inherits from `System.EventArgs` and is named after the event.

This follows the .NET Framework Design Guidelines and makes event declarations consistent and predictable.
The `EventArgs` type name should match the event name to show the relationship between them.

For example, a `Loaded` event should use an `EventHandler<LoadedEventArgs>`.

This pattern makes it clear what data is associated with each event and ensures type safety.

### Rationale behind

Using `EventHandler<T>` with appropriately named `EventArgs` types creates clear, type-safe, and discoverable event APIs.
This pattern is recommended by the .NET Framework Design Guidelines and establishes an explicit relationship between events and their associated data.

When an event named `Loaded` uses `EventHandler<LoadedEventArgs>`, developers immediately understand which data class contains information specific to that event.
This naming correlation improves API discoverability through IntelliSense.

Following this pattern provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Type-Event Relationship**:
  The matching names create an obvious connection between an event and its data type.
  Developers immediately know which `EventArgs` type to use when handling a specific event.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  When developers subscribe to an event, they can easily find the corresponding `EventArgs` type by looking for a type with a matching name.
  This predictability reduces the need to search through documentation.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  Related event and `EventArgs` types appear together in IntelliSense, making it intuitive to work with events and their data.
  This proximity improves the development experience.

- **Type Safety**:
  Using `EventHandler<T>` provides compile-time type checking for event data.
  This prevents runtime errors and makes code more robust.

- **Flexible Extension**:
  Each event has a dedicated `EventArgs` type that can be extended with additional properties as needed.
  This extensibility does not break existing event handler signatures.

- **Modern .NET Alignment**:
  This pattern is used throughout modern .NET frameworks like WPF and ASP.NET Core.
  Following it makes custom code feel integrated with current platform conventions.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  The explicit relationship between events and their data types promotes better organization.
  Each event has a clear, dedicated type for its data, avoiding generic or ambiguous `EventArgs` usage.

- **Professional API Design**:
  This approach is more professional than using generic `EventArgs` or custom delegate types.
  It signals that the API follows established best practices and design guidelines.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the event to use `EventHandler<T>` where `T` is an `EventArgs` type named after the event.

#pragma warning disable MiKo_1006
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1006
