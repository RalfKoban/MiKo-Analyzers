# MiKo_5011: Do not concatenate strings with += operator

## Cause

Strings are concatenated using the `+=` operator.

## Rule description

Do not use `+=` for string concatenation.
It creates unnecessary string allocations, putting pressure on the garbage collector.
Instead, use 'string.Concat()`, 'string.Join()`, or `StringBuilder` to boost performance and reduce garbage collector load.

### Rationale behind

Strings in .NET are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation.
When the `+=` operator is used to concatenate strings, a new string object is created for each operation, and the old string becomes garbage.
In loops or repeated concatenations, this creates many temporary string objects that the garbage collector must clean up.

Using appropriate string concatenation methods provides important benefits:

- **Fewer Memory Allocations**:
  `StringBuilder` reuses an internal buffer and only allocates new memory when needed.
  Each `+=` operation creates a new string object, even for small concatenations.

- **Reduced Garbage Collection Pressure**:
  Temporary strings created by `+=` immediately become garbage.
  Methods like `StringBuilder` minimize garbage by reusing buffers.

- **Better Performance in Loops**:
  Using `+=` in a loop creates a number of temporary strings equal to the number of iterations.
  `StringBuilder` avoids this by building the final string in a single buffer.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Using 'string.Join()` or 'string.Concat()` clearly communicates that multiple strings are being combined.
  Multiple `+=` statements can be harder to read and understand.

- **Predictable Performance**:
  `StringBuilder` has predictable performance characteristics.
  The `+=` operator can cause performance degradation that is hard to diagnose when many concatenations occur.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use `StringBuilder` for multiple concatenations, 'string.Join()` for collections, or 'string.Concat()` for a few strings.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5011
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5011
```
