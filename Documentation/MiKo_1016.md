# MiKo_1016: Name factory methods `Create`

## Cause

A method in a factory class does not start with `Create`.

## Rule description

Since the method is part of a factory, its name should begin with `Create`.
This helps indicate its purpose more clearly.

Factory methods are responsible for creating and returning new instances.
Starting their names with `Create` follows the Factory Method design pattern and makes it immediately obvious what these methods do.

This naming convention is used throughout the .NET Framework and in common design patterns.

### Rationale behind

Naming factory methods with the `Create` prefix is essential for creating clear, maintainable code that follows established design patterns.
The Factory Method pattern is one of the most fundamental design patterns, and `Create` is the universally recognized verb for factory operations.
Using `Create` makes it immediately obvious that a method is allocating a new object, distinguishing it from methods that might retrieve, find, or return existing instances.

This clarity is critical for understanding object lifetime and memory allocation patterns in applications.
The `Create` prefix also aligns with .NET Framework conventions (e.g., `XmlReader.Create`, `Task.Create`) and industry-wide practices, making code instantly familiar to experienced developers.

Following this pattern provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Object Lifetime Semantics**:
  The `Create` prefix immediately signals that a new object is being allocated.
  This distinguishes factory methods from methods that retrieve or find existing instances.

- **Framework Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework uses `Create` for factory methods (e.g., `XmlReader.Create`, `Task.Create`).
  Following this convention makes custom code feel integrated with platform standards.

- **Design Pattern Recognition**:
  `Create` is the universally recognized verb for the Factory Method pattern.
  This makes the design pattern immediately obvious to developers.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  When factory methods consistently use `Create`, all object creation points are trivial to identify.
  This is valuable during debugging, performance optimization, and architectural reviews.

- **Predictable API Behavior**:
  Developers know that methods starting with `Create` will return new instances.
  This predictability makes APIs easier to use correctly without documentation.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Following established design pattern conventions signals well-designed, professional code.
  It demonstrates understanding of software architecture principles.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the factory method to start with `Create`.
