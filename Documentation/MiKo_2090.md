# MiKo_2090: Use default phrase for equality operator documentation

## Cause

The documentation for an equality operator does not use the standard default phrase.

## Rule description

For smoother development and usage, XML documentation for equality operators should use a standard default phrase, like in the .NET framework.
This keeps things consistent and makes it easier for developers to understand and implement these operators correctly.

### Rationale behind

Equality operators are a fundamental part of .NET types and have well-established documentation patterns used throughout the .NET Framework and standard libraries.
Using consistent phrasing for these operators makes APIs feel familiar and professional.

When equality operators have inconsistent or non-standard documentation, it can confuse developers who are accustomed to seeing the standard pattern.
Consistent documentation also makes it easier to quickly understand what the operator does without having to read custom descriptions.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent API Feel**:
  Using the same documentation pattern as .NET Framework makes the codebase feel like a natural extension of the platform.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers can quickly recognize equality operators and understand their behavior from familiar documentation.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  Standard documentation patterns require less time to understand than custom descriptions.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Consistency with .NET conventions demonstrates knowledge of platform best practices.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  Familiar documentation patterns allow developers to work more efficiently without stopping to interpret custom wording.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the equality operator documentation to use the standard phrase used in .NET Framework documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2090
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2090
```
