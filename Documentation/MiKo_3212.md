# MiKo_3212: Follow standard Dispose pattern without adding other Dispose methods

## Cause

A type contains methods named `Dispose` that do not follow the standard Dispose pattern.

## Rule description

Stick to the basic Dispose pattern to avoid confusing developers.
The only methods named `Dispose` should be void `IDisposable.Dispose()` and `void Dispose(bool disposing)`.
Any other methods would deviate from the Dispose pattern and cause confusion.

### Rationale behind

The Dispose pattern is a well-established convention in .NET for deterministic resource cleanup.
Deviating from this pattern by adding other `Dispose` methods creates confusion about which method to call and when.

Following the standard Dispose pattern provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  The standard pattern is universally recognized by .NET developers.
  Following it makes the code immediately familiar.

- **Better Usability**:
  Developers know exactly how to use types that follow the standard pattern.
  There is no confusion about which `Dispose` method to call.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Additional `Dispose` methods can lead to incorrect usage patterns.
  Sticking to the standard prevents these mistakes.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code that follows established patterns is easier to maintain and modify.
  Future developers understand the pattern without additional documentation.

- **Framework Integration**:
  The standard pattern works seamlessly with `using` statements and other framework features.
  Custom variations may not integrate as well.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Following the standard pattern clearly communicates resource management intent.
  There is no ambiguity about the type's disposal semantics.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename or remove additional `Dispose` methods that do not fit the standard pattern.
Ensure the type implements only `void Dispose()` from `IDisposable` and optionally `void Dispose(bool disposing)` for the full pattern.
If other cleanup methods are needed, give them different names that do not conflict with the Dispose pattern.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3212
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3212
```
