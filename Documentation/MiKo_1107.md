# MiKo_1107: Do not use Pascal-casing for test methods

## Cause

A test method uses Pascal-casing instead of the recommended naming convention using underscores to separate the words.

## Rule description

Test methods should not use Pascal-casing like `MethodReturnsResult` or `UserSavesFileToHarddisk`.
Instead, they should use underscores to separate words, making the test's intent clear and readable.

### Rationale behind

Avoiding Pascal-casing for test methods is important for test readability and maintainability.

Using underscores to separate words instead of Pascal-casing provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Test names with underscores read like natural sentences, making it immediately clear what behavior is being tested.
  `User_saves_file_to_harddisk` is much easier to parse than `UserSavesFileToHarddisk`.
  Pascal-casing tends to compress words together, which can be harder to scan quickly.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  The underscore-separated naming convention allows for longer, more specific test names that fully describe the scenario and expected outcome.
  This reduces the need to read the test implementation to understand what it validates.

- **Better Test Reports**:
  When tests fail in continuous integration or test runners, readable test names make it immediately clear what functionality broke without opening the code.
  This speeds up debugging and issue resolution.

- **Living Documentation**:
  Well-named tests serve as executable documentation of how the system should behave.
  Names that read like sentences make this documentation more accessible to all team members.

- **Easier Test Discovery**:
  When test names clearly describe scenarios, it is easier to find existing tests for specific behaviors and identify gaps in test coverage.

- **Consistent Pattern**:
  Using underscores creates a uniform naming pattern across all test methods, making the test suite feel cohesive and professional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test method to use underscores to separate words instead of Pascal-casing.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1107
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1107
```
