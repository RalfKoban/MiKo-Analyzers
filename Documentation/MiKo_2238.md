# MiKo_2238: Do not start `<summary>` documentation with `Make sure to call this`

## Cause

A `<summary>` tag starts with the vague phrase `Make sure to call this` instead of describing what the method actually does.

## Rule description

XML documentation should be clear and purposeful.
Vague phrases like "Make sure to call this" fail to describe the functionality or behavior of the code, leading to ambiguity about the method's purpose.
Such documentation also undermines tool integration and usability, as IDEs rely on precise descriptions to generate meaningful IntelliSense tooltips and enhance developer productivity.

### Rationale behind

Documentation that starts with "Make sure to call this" tells developers nothing about what the method does, why it exists, or when it should be called.
This creates confusion and forces developers to read the implementation to understand the method's purpose.

Avoiding this phrase and providing clear descriptions provides several important benefits:

- **Describes Actual Functionality**:
  Good documentation explains what a method does, what parameters it accepts, and what it returns.
  "Make sure to call this" provides none of this essential information.

- **Improves IntelliSense Usefulness**:
  When developers hover over a method, they need to know what it does.
  Vague phrases make IntelliSense tooltips useless and force developers to dig into the code.

- **Reduces Investigation Time**:
  Clear documentation allows developers to understand methods without reading the implementation.
  Vague documentation wastes time and reduces productivity.

- **Prevents Misuse**:
  When documentation clearly explains what a method does and when to use it, developers can use it correctly.
  Vague documentation increases the risk of incorrect usage.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Clear, descriptive documentation demonstrates professionalism and attention to quality.
  Vague phrases suggest incomplete or rushed work.

- **Better Collaboration**:
  Team members can work more effectively when they can quickly understand what each method does without needing to ask questions or read implementation details.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace vague phrases like "Make sure to call this" with a clear description of what the method does, its purpose, and when it should be used.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2238
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2238
```
