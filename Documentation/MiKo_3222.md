# MiKo_3222: Simplify string comparisons

## Cause

A logical OR condition combines a reference equality check with an explicit null-safe `Equals` call, creating a redundant pattern.

## Rule description

Simplify string comparisons for equality by using specific methods from the .NET framework.
This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Complex string comparison patterns can be difficult to read and understand.
The .NET framework provides the static `string.Equals()` method that is designed to handle null values correctly, making intent clearer.

Simplifying string comparisons provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Using `string.Equals()` makes the code's intent immediately clear.
  Developers can quickly understand that a null-safe string comparison is being performed.

- **Better Performance**:
  The static `string.Equals()` method is optimized and avoids redundant checks.
  It eliminates the need to check equality twice (once with `==` and once with `Equals`).

- **Reduced Errors**:
  The static `string.Equals()` method handles edge cases correctly, including null strings.
  This reduces the likelihood of bugs from manually implementing null checks.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Clear, simple comparison patterns are easier to modify when requirements change.
  There is less chance of introducing errors during updates.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  `string.Equals()` explicitly communicates that a null-safe string comparison is being performed.
  This makes the code self-documenting.

- **Consistency**:
  Using the standard `string.Equals()` method ensures the codebase follows common .NET patterns.
  This makes it easier for developers to navigate and understand the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the redundant null-check pattern with `string.Equals()`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3222
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3222
```
