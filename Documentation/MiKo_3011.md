# MiKo_3011: Provide correct parameter name for `ArgumentException`s

## Cause

An `ArgumentException` (or subtype) is thrown without providing the parameter name, or with an incorrect parameter name.

## Rule description

Thrown `ArgumentException`s (or its subtypes) should always include the name of the parameter that caused the exception.
This practice helps other developers quickly identify the problematic argument, facilitating easier debugging and improving overall code maintainability.

### Rationale behind

ArgumentExceptions without proper parameter names provide incomplete information about what went wrong.
When debugging issues, developers need to know exactly which parameter caused the problem to fix it efficiently.

Including correct parameter names in `ArgumentException`s provides several important benefits:

- **Faster Debugging**:
  When an exception includes the parameter name, developers immediately know which argument is invalid.
  This eliminates the need to inspect the code to determine the source of the problem.

- **Better Error Messages**:
  Exception messages that include parameter names are more informative and actionable.
  Developers can quickly understand what needs to be corrected.

- **Improved Code Quality**:
  Properly constructed exceptions demonstrate attention to detail and professional coding practices.
  This raises the overall quality standard of the codebase.

- **Easier Troubleshooting**:
  Support teams and operations staff can identify problems faster when exceptions are specific.
  This reduces the time needed to diagnose and resolve issues.

- **Clearer API Contracts**:
  Well-documented exceptions communicate the expected parameter constraints.
  This helps API consumers understand how to use methods correctly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the `ArgumentException` constructor includes the correct parameter name using the `nameof` operator.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3011
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3011
```
