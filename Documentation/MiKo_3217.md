# MiKo_3217: Do not use generic types that have other generic types as type arguments

## Cause

A generic type uses another generic type as a type argument.

## Rule description

Generic types with other generic types as type arguments are hard to understand and maintain.
This complexity makes it difficult to interpret their purpose and suggests hidden type information due to primitive obsession.

Instead, use non-generic types as type arguments.
This approach makes the code's intent clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Nesting generic types creates complex type signatures that are difficult to read and understand.
Such constructs often indicate that domain concepts are being represented using primitive or generic types instead of meaningful domain types.

Using non-generic types as type arguments provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Type signatures with concrete types are much easier to understand.
  Developers can immediately grasp what the type represents.

- **Better Domain Modeling**:
  Creating specific types for domain concepts makes the code more expressive.
  The type system better reflects the business domain.

- **Enhanced Type Safety**:
  Specific types prevent mixing unrelated concepts that happen to have the same structure.
  The compiler can catch more errors at compile time.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Simpler type signatures reduce cognitive load when reading code.
  Developers do not need to parse complex nested generics.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Named domain types communicate purpose directly.
  The code is more self-documenting.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Changes to domain concepts can be made in dedicated types.
  The impact of changes is more contained and predictable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, create specific non-generic types to represent the concepts currently expressed through nested generics.
Replace the nested generic type arguments with these concrete types.
This often involves creating domain-specific classes or structs.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3217
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3217
```
