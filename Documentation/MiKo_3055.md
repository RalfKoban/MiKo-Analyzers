# MiKo_3055: Implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` in ViewModels

## Cause

A ViewModel class does not implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface.

## Rule description

In WPF, view models use bindings.
If a view model does not implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`, WPF uses reflection to detect changes, causing a memory leak.
The binding instance (descriptor) stays in a static hash table for the app's lifetime.
To avoid this, make sure types implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` and raise the corresponding events when changes occur.

### Rationale behind

WPF's data binding system needs to know when property values change so it can update the user interface.
Without proper change notification, WPF falls back to inefficient and problematic detection mechanisms.

Implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged` provides several important benefits:

- **Memory Leak Prevention**:
  WPF creates PropertyDescriptor instances for properties without change notification.
  These descriptors are cached indefinitely, causing memory leaks when view models are discarded.

- **Performance**:
  Proper change notification allows WPF to update only what changed.
  Without it, WPF may need to use polling or reflection, which is significantly slower.

- **Responsive UI**:
  Change notifications ensure the UI updates immediately when data changes.
  Without them, the UI may appear stale or require manual refresh actions.

- **Correct Binding Behavior**:
  Bindings work as expected when properties notify changes.
  Without notification, bindings may not update even when the underlying data changes.

- **Framework Expectations**:
  WPF ViewModels are expected to implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`.
  Following this convention ensures compatibility with WPF features and third-party libraries.

- **Debugging Support**:
  Proper change notification makes it easier to track data flow through the application.
  Missing notifications can make bugs difficult to diagnose because the UI does not reflect the actual state.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface in the ViewModel class.
Add a `PropertyChanged` event and create a method to raise it.
Ensure all property setters raise the event when values change.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3055
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3055
```
