# MiKo_1031: Do not suffix entity types with `Model`

## Cause

An entity type name ends with the suffix `Model`.

## Rule description

Using `Model` as a suffix for entity types is unnecessary.
Entities should just be named plainly without any suffixes.
For example, use `User` instead of `UserModel`.

The term `Model` is often overused and does not provide meaningful information about the type's purpose.
Entity names should directly represent the domain concept they model.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing entity types with `Model` is a common anti-pattern that adds noise without conveying semantic meaning.
In domain-driven design and clean architecture, entities represent core business concepts and should be named directly after those concepts to maintain clarity and expressiveness.

When every entity has a `Model` suffix, the term becomes meaningless background noise that lengthens names without improving understanding.
Clean, direct entity names improve code readability, align with ubiquitous language principles, and make the codebase feel more professional and well-designed.

Removing the `Model` suffix provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Direct entity names like `User` or `Product` immediately convey what the type represents.
  Adding `Model` dilutes this clarity without adding information.

- **Better Communication**:
  Developers say "User" in conversation but must remember to type "UserModel" in code, creating unnecessary mental overhead.
  Consistent naming between speech and code improves team communication.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Entity names directly reflect business concepts rather than technical classifications.
  When business terminology changes, only the core name needs updating, not technical suffixes.

- **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**:
  If different representations are needed (for example, domain model versus view model), use more specific suffixes or organize them in different namespaces.
  Blanket use of `Model` indicates poor architectural boundaries.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Clean, direct names make the codebase feel more polished and well-designed.
  They signal attention to detail and careful architectural thinking.

- **Alignment with Ubiquitous Language**:
  Domain-driven design emphasizes using the same language that business stakeholders use.
  Business discussions reference `Users` and `Products`, not `UserModels` and `ProductModels`.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to remove the `Model` suffix, using a name that directly represents the business concept.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1031
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1031
