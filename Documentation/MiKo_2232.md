# MiKo_2232: Do not leave `<summary>` documentation empty

## Cause

A `<summary>` XML documentation tag has been created but left empty without any content.

## Rule description

Empty `<summary>` documentation adds no value and should be removed.
It creates clutter and does not aid developers in understanding the code.
Proper documentation should always provide meaningful and useful information.

### Rationale behind

An empty `<summary>` tag serves absolutely no purpose and actively harms code quality.
It suggests incomplete work and creates a negative impression without providing any benefit.

Removing or properly filling empty `<summary>` tags provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Visual Clutter**:
  Empty tags take up space in code files without adding value.
  Removing them makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  When developers see an empty `<summary>` tag, they do not know if documentation was forgotten or if the element is considered self-explanatory.
  This creates uncertainty.

- **Improves IntelliSense**:
  Empty summaries show up as blank tooltips in IntelliSense, which is unhelpful and looks unprofessional.
  Removing them or adding content makes IntelliSense useful.

- **Signals Incomplete Work**:
  Empty documentation tags suggest that the code might also be incomplete or insufficiently tested.
  This undermines confidence in the codebase.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers must question whether empty documentation was intentional or accidental.
  Removing empty tags makes reviews more efficient.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Documentation should either be complete and useful or not present at all.
  Empty tags fail on both counts and make the codebase appear neglected.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, either provide meaningful content for the `<summary>` tag or remove the empty tag entirely.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2232
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2232
```
