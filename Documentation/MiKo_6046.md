# MiKo_6046: Place calculations using operators such as `+` or `%` on same line(s)

## Cause

Calculation operators and their operands are split across multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when calculations operators such as `+` or `%` are placed on the same lines as their operands.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Mathematical calculations are common in many applications, from simple arithmetic to complex formulas.
When calculation operations are split across multiple lines unnecessarily, they become harder to read and the mathematical relationships become less clear.

Placing calculation operators and operands on the same lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete calculation is visible at a glance, making it easy to understand what mathematical operation is being performed.
  Developers can see the formula without scanning multiple lines.

- **Clearer Mathematical Intent**:
  Compact calculations preserve the natural mathematical notation that developers are familiar with.
  This makes it easier to verify that the formula is correct and implements the intended logic.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When calculations fit on one line, they can be processed as single mathematical expressions.
  Developers do not need to mentally reconstruct the formula from scattered pieces.

- **Easier Verification**:
  Compact calculations are easier to verify against specifications or mathematical formulas.
  Reviewers can quickly check that the implementation matches the intended calculation.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  When calculations are compact, it is easier to scan through code and identify where mathematical operations occur.
  This is helpful when debugging or optimizing numeric algorithms.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Calculation expressions read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows standard mathematical notation and makes the code more intuitive.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the calculation operator and its operands to the same line.
Ensure that the complete calculation expression is on a single line when reasonable.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6046
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6046
```
