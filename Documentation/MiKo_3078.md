# MiKo_3078: Provide default values for enum members

## Cause

An enum member does not have an explicitly assigned value.

## Rule description

Explicitly setting values for `Enum` members prevents changes in meaning when the `Enum` is modified, whether by adding, removing, renaming, or reordering values.
This approach ensures stability and clarity, keeping the `Enum`'s behavior consistent as it evolves.
It makes everything reliable and easy to understand.

### Rationale behind

When enum members do not have explicit values, they are automatically assigned sequential values starting from zero.
While this seems convenient, it creates maintenance problems when the enum needs to be modified because any change to the order can alter the numeric values associated with each member.

Explicitly assigning values to enum members provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Value Changes During Maintenance**:
  When enum members are reordered or new members are inserted, explicitly assigned values remain constant.
  This prevents bugs where saved or transmitted enum values become associated with different meanings after code changes.

- **Supports Serialization and Persistence**:
  Enums are often serialized to databases, files, or network messages using their numeric values.
  Explicit values ensure that stored data remains valid even when the enum definition is modified.

- **Enables Safe Enum Evolution**:
  New enum members can be added anywhere in the definition without affecting existing values.
  This makes it safe to organize enum members logically rather than being constrained by initialization order.

- **Improves API Stability**:
  When enums are part of public APIs or data contracts, explicit values prevent breaking changes.
  Clients can rely on specific numeric values remaining constant across versions.

- **Makes Values Self-Documenting**:
  Explicit values make it clear what numeric value each member represents.
  This is particularly important when enums map to external systems, protocols, or standards that require specific values.

- **Prevents Accidental Duplicates**:
  When assigning values explicitly, duplicate values become immediately obvious.
  With automatic values, duplicates can only occur through explicit assignment, making them easier to catch in code review.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, explicitly assign a numeric value to each enum member.
Start with zero for the first member and increment for subsequent members, or use values that match external specifications or requirements.
Ensure that each value is unique unless flags enums are intentionally designed with combined values.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3078
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3078
```
