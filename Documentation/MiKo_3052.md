# MiKo_3052: Declare `DependencyPropertyKey` fields as non-public `static readonly`

## Cause

A `DependencyPropertyKey` field is not declared as non-public `static readonly`.

## Rule description

Make fields backing a `DependencyPropertyKey` non-public, static, and readonly.
This prevents clients from finding and accessing these fields, ensuring code stays secure and well-encapsulated.

### Rationale behind

`DependencyPropertyKey` fields are used to create read-only dependency properties in WPF.
These keys should be kept private or protected to prevent external code from modifying properties that should only be changed internally.

Declaring dependency property keys as non-public static readonly provides several important benefits:

- **Proper Encapsulation**:
  Non-public keys prevent external code from setting read-only properties.
  This enforces the read-only contract and protects the integrity of the property.

- **Security**:
  Exposing keys would allow any code to modify properties that should be controlled.
  Keeping keys private ensures only the owning class can make changes.

- **Clear Intent**:
  Non-public visibility signals that the property is read-only from external perspectives.
  This makes the design intention obvious to other developers.

- **Immutability**:
  The `readonly` modifier ensures the key cannot be reassigned after initialization.
  This prevents accidental modifications that would break the property system.

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  Static fields ensure only one key instance exists per type.
  This is essential for proper dependency property metadata management.

- **Framework Compliance**:
  WPF expects read-only dependency properties to follow this pattern.
  Deviating from it can cause unexpected behavior or framework errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the `DependencyPropertyKey` field to be non-public (typically `private` or `protected`), `static`, and `readonly`.
Ensure the field is not accessible outside the declaring class or its derived classes.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3052
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3052
```
