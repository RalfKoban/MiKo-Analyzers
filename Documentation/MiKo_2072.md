# MiKo_2072: Do not start `<summary>` documentation with `Try`

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation of a `Try` method starts with `Try`.

## Rule description

`Try` methods attempt to achieve something.
Therefore, their `<summary>` documentation should start with `Attempts to...`
This clearly indicates the method's purpose and conveys its intent.

### Rationale behind

Methods that start with `Try` have a specific pattern in .NET where they attempt an operation that might fail without throwing an exception.
Documentation that starts with `Try` simply repeats the method name without adding any useful information.

Starting with `Attempts to` immediately communicates that the method might not succeed and that callers should check the return value.
This helps developers understand the method's behavior and expected usage pattern.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Intent**:
  `Attempts to` explicitly communicates that the operation might fail, setting proper expectations for the method's behavior.

- **Better Usability**:
  Developers immediately understand they need to check the result and handle both success and failure cases.

- **Consistent Documentation**:
  Using `Attempts to` creates a uniform pattern for all Try methods across the codebase.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Avoiding repetition of the method name makes the documentation more informative and valuable.

- **Improved Error Handling**:
  When documentation clearly indicates the method might fail, developers are more likely to write proper error handling code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `Try` at the start of the documentation with `Attempts to`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2072
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2072
```
