# MiKo_6016: Surround using statements with blank lines

## Cause

`using` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `using` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `using` statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear code structure and resource management visibility.
Using statements manage disposable resources automatically, and visually separating them helps developers understand where resources are acquired, used, and automatically disposed, which is essential for proper resource management.

Surrounding using statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Resource Management Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `using` statements stand out as resource management blocks.
  Developers can immediately identify where disposable resources are managed in the code.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When `using` statements are visually separated, the code structure is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that resource lifecycle management is occurring.

- **Better Resource Scope Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the scope of resource usage.
  The boundaries make it clear where resources are acquired and automatically disposed.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Visually distinct `using` statements are easier to locate when navigating through code.
  Developers can quickly find resource management blocks without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated `using` statements are easier to work with during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify resource boundaries to diagnose disposal or lifecycle issues.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When `using` statements are clearly separated, modifying resource management is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where resources are managed, reducing the risk of resource leaks.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `using` statements.
Ensure each using block is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6016
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6016
```
