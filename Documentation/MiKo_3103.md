# MiKo_3103: Do not use `Guid.NewGuid()` in test methods

## Cause

A test method uses `Guid.NewGuid()` to generate a GUID value.

## Rule description

Tests should be as specific as possible, to be reproducible and easy to maintain.
Generated GUIDs are not reproducible and hard to track if a test fails.
Instead, use a hard-coded GUID for consistency and as debugging aid.
This ensures tests are clear and reliable and help when debugging is necessary.

### Rationale behind

Test reproducibility is critical for reliable software development.
When tests use randomly generated values, they become harder to debug and maintain because the exact test conditions cannot be reproduced.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Test Reproducibility**:
  Hard-coded GUIDs ensure the test runs with the same values every time.
  Developers can reproduce test failures exactly as they occurred, making debugging straightforward.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When a test fails with a specific GUID value, developers can see that exact value in the test code.
  There is no need to capture or log runtime values to understand what was being tested.

- **Better Test Readability**:
  Hard-coded values make tests self-documenting.
  Developers can immediately see what specific data the test is using without running the code.

- **Simplified Test Maintenance**:
  Tests with fixed values are easier to understand and modify.
  Changes to test expectations can be made with confidence because the input values are known and predictable.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Using specific GUID values communicates that the actual GUID value matters for the test.
  This helps developers understand whether the test is checking GUID-specific behavior or if any GUID would suffice.

- **Consistent Test Results**:
  Tests with fixed values produce consistent results across different environments and runs.
  This eliminates false positives or negatives caused by randomly generated data.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `Guid.NewGuid()` with a hard-coded GUID value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3103
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3103
```
