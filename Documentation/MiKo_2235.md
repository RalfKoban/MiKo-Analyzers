# MiKo_2235: Use `will` instead of `going to` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains the verbose phrase `going to` instead of the simpler `will`.

## Rule description

The phrase `going to` is more verbose and effectively means `will`.
Opting for `will` instead promotes clarity and conciseness, making the code's behavior easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

The phrase `going to` is informal and wordy compared to `will`.
Using more concise language makes documentation more professional and easier to read.

Using `will` instead of `going to` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Replacing two words with one makes documentation more compact.
  This allows readers to absorb information more quickly.

- **Enhanced Professionalism**:
  `Will` is the standard term in formal and technical writing.
  `Going to` is more casual and conversational, which is less appropriate for API documentation.

- **Better Clarity**:
  `Will` clearly indicates future action or behavior.
  It is direct and unambiguous, making documentation easier to understand.

- **Consistent Tone**:
  Technical documentation should maintain a professional, neutral tone.
  Using `will` helps achieve this consistency throughout the codebase.

- **Faster Reading**:
  Shorter phrases are processed more quickly by readers.
  Every word saved contributes to faster comprehension.

- **International Accessibility**:
  For non-native English speakers, `will` is typically taught as the standard future tense.
  `Going to` may be less familiar or require additional processing.
