# MiKo_2214: Remove empty lines from documentation

## Cause

The documentation contains empty lines.

## Rule description

To avoid dense text in generated documentation (e.g., IntelliSense), empty lines should not be used.
Developers often insert them to create paragraphs, but they get ignored and removed.
Instead, use `<para>` tags, which are designed to mark paragraphs properly, ensuring the generated documentation remains clear and well-structured.

### Rationale behind

Empty lines in XML documentation do not translate to visual spacing in IntelliSense or generated documentation.
Documentation tools strip out whitespace, so empty lines serve no purpose and can give a false impression in the source code.

The `<para>` tag is specifically designed to create paragraph breaks in XML documentation and is properly recognized by all documentation tools.
Using the correct tag ensures that paragraph breaks appear as intended in all documentation viewers.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Correct Paragraph Formatting**:
  Using `<para>` tags ensures paragraph breaks appear in IntelliSense and generated documentation.

- **Consistent Output**:
  Documentation appears the same across all viewers and tools when proper tags are used.

- **Eliminated False Expectations**:
  Developers do not mistakenly believe that empty lines will create spacing in output documentation.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Using proper XML tags demonstrates knowledge of documentation best practices.

- **Better Structure**:
  `<para>` tags make the document structure explicit and processable by tools.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove empty lines from the documentation and use `<para>` tags to separate paragraphs.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2214
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2214
```
