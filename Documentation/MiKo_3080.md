# MiKo_3080: Use `switch ... return` instead of `switch ... break` for variable assignments

## Cause

A switch statement assigns values to a variable using `break` statements instead of returning values directly.

## Rule description

Using switch statements to assign variables within methods increases complexity and reduces readability.
Simplify this by refactoring the switch statement into its own method.
Let each section of the switch return values directly, instead of assigning them to a shared variable and using break statements.
This approach enhances clarity and maintainability.

### Rationale behind

Switch statements that assign to a variable and use `break` create unnecessary complexity and make the code harder to follow.
This pattern requires declaring a variable, assigning it in multiple places, and returning it at the end, which adds cognitive load for developers reading the code.

Using direct returns from switch statements provides several important benefits:

- **Reduces Code Complexity**:
  Eliminating the intermediate variable and break statements makes the switch statement simpler.
  Each case clearly shows what value is produced without tracking variable mutations.

- **Improves Readability**:
  Direct returns make it immediately obvious what value each case produces.
  There is no need to scan through the code to find where the variable is declared or returned.

- **Prevents Assignment Errors**:
  When using a shared variable, it is possible to forget to assign it in some cases or to assign it multiple times.
  Direct returns eliminate these errors because each case must explicitly produce a value.

- **Enables Expression-Based Patterns**:
  Modern C# supports switch expressions that are more concise than switch statements.
  Refactoring to use returns prepares the code for potential migration to switch expressions.

- **Simplifies Method Structure**:
  Extracting the switch into its own method with direct returns creates a focused function with a single purpose.
  This follows the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code easier to test.

- **Makes Control Flow Clearer**:
  Direct returns make it obvious that each case terminates the switch logic.
  Break statements can be confused with breaking out of loops or can be accidentally omitted.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, extract the switch statement into a separate method.
Change each case to return the value directly instead of assigning to a variable and using `break`.
Call this new method from the original location and use its return value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3080
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3080
```
