# MiKo_3072: Do not return `List<>` or `Dictionary<>` from non-private methods

## Cause

A non-private method returns `List<>` or `Dictionary<>` instead of an interface.

## Rule description

Public methods should return interfaces like `IList<>` or `IDictionary<>` instead of concrete types like `List<>` or `Dictionary<>`.
This approach provides flexibility, allowing changes to the implementation of the return value without affecting the method's signature, keeping the code adaptable and maintainable.

### Rationale behind

Returning concrete collection types from public APIs creates tight coupling between the implementation and callers.
When methods return specific collection types, changing the implementation later becomes difficult without breaking existing code.

Returning interfaces instead of concrete types provides several important benefits:

- **Enables Implementation Flexibility**:
  When a method returns `IList<>` instead of `List<>`, the implementation can be changed to return any list type without breaking callers.
  This allows optimization or changes in data structures as requirements evolve.

- **Reduces Coupling**:
  Callers only depend on the interface contract, not on the specific implementation.
  This makes the code more modular and easier to refactor or replace components.

- **Improves Testability**:
  When methods work with interfaces, it becomes easier to provide mock or stub implementations during testing.
  This enables better unit testing and isolation of components.

- **Follows Design Principles**:
  Returning interfaces follows the principle of programming to an interface rather than an implementation.
  This is a fundamental best practice in object-oriented design.

- **Prevents Unintended Modifications**:
  When callers receive an interface, they cannot access implementation-specific methods that might not be part of the intended contract.
  This helps maintain encapsulation and control over the collection.

- **Supports Read-Only Scenarios**:
  Returning `IEnumerable<>` or `IReadOnlyList<>` instead of `List<>` clearly communicates whether the collection is meant to be modified.
  This makes the API's intent clearer and prevents accidental mutations.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the return type from `List<>` to `IList<>`, `IReadOnlyList<>`, or `IEnumerable<>` depending on the intended usage.
Similarly, change `Dictionary<>` to `IDictionary<>` or `IReadOnlyDictionary<>`.
Consider whether callers need to modify the collection when choosing between read-only and mutable interfaces.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3072
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3072
```
