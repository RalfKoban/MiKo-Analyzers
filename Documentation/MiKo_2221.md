# MiKo_2221: Do not use empty XML tags in documentation

## Cause

An XML documentation tag has been created but left empty without any content.

## Rule description

An empty documentation is a code smell.
It indicates that the developer created the XML documentation tag intentionally but failed to provide any actual content.
This suggests a potential oversight or lack of attention to detail.
Proper documentation is crucial for code clarity and maintenance.

### Rationale behind

Empty XML tags serve no purpose and actively harm the codebase quality.
They suggest incomplete work and create a negative impression on anyone reading the code.

Avoiding empty XML tags provides several important benefits:

- **Signals Incomplete Work**:
  Empty tags clearly indicate that documentation was started but never finished.
  This creates uncertainty about whether the code itself is also incomplete or untested.

- **Wastes Developer Time**:
  When developers encounter empty documentation tags, they must spend time investigating whether the tag should contain information or be removed entirely.
  This interrupts workflow and reduces productivity.

- **Reduces Code Quality**:
  Empty tags are visual clutter that makes code harder to read and navigate.
  They distract from meaningful content and make it harder to spot actual documentation issues.

- **Undermines Trust**:
  When documentation appears neglected, it raises questions about the overall code quality and maintenance practices.
  Developers may lose confidence in the codebase.

- **Prevents Tool Integration**:
  Documentation tools and IDEs expect XML tags to contain meaningful content.
  Empty tags can confuse these tools or produce unhelpful output in IntelliSense or generated documentation.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Removing empty tags makes code reviews more focused on actual functionality rather than questioning why documentation was left incomplete.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, either provide meaningful content for the XML documentation tag or remove the empty tag entirely.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2221
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2221
```
