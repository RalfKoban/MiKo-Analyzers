# MiKo_2100: Start `<example>` documentation with descriptive default phrase

## Cause

The `<example>` documentation does not start with a descriptive phrase that explains what the example demonstrates.

## Rule description

To make example documentation more user-friendly, it should begin with a brief phrase that explains what the example demonstrates.
This provides clarity and helps developers quickly understand the purpose of the example.

### Rationale behind

Examples in documentation serve to show developers how to use a type or member in practice.
Without an introductory explanation, developers must read through the entire code example to understand what it demonstrates.

A brief descriptive phrase at the start of an example sets context and helps developers decide whether the example is relevant to their current task.
This saves time and improves the overall usefulness of the documentation.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers can quickly scan examples to find the one that matches their needs without reading all the code.

- **Better Context**:
  An introductory phrase explains the scenario or use case being demonstrated, making the example easier to understand.

- **Time Savings**:
  Developers can determine at a glance whether an example is relevant before investing time in studying the code.

- **Enhanced Learning**:
  Clear explanations help developers understand not just how to use something, but when and why to use it.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Well-structured examples with clear descriptions demonstrate attention to quality and user experience.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a descriptive phrase at the beginning of the `<example>` section that explains what the example demonstrates.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2100
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2100
```
