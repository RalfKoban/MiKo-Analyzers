# MiKo_2047: Start Attribute `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

An Attribute `<summary>` documentation does not start with a default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation of an Attribute should start with a specific phrase that describes its purpose and how it is applied.

### Rationale behind

Attributes in .NET are used to add metadata to code elements such as classes, methods, properties, and parameters.
Using a consistent starting phrase for attribute documentation helps developers immediately recognize the type as an attribute and understand what metadata it provides.

Following a standard format for attribute documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Attribute Identity**:
  Starting attribute documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear that the type is an attribute.
  Developers can quickly identify attributes and understand their purpose.

- **Better Understanding of Metadata**:
  Attribute documentation should explain what metadata the attribute provides and how it affects the decorated element.
  A consistent starting phrase leads naturally into this explanation.

- **Consistent .NET Conventions**:
  Many .NET Framework attributes follow consistent documentation patterns, and using a similar approach makes the codebase feel more aligned with .NET standards.
  This consistency improves the overall quality of the documentation.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  When attributes are consistently documented, developers can more easily discover and understand available attributes.
  This helps them use attributes correctly in their code.

- **Clear Usage Context**:
  Attribute documentation should indicate what types of code elements the attribute can be applied to.
  Consistent documentation makes this information easier to find and understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the attribute documentation with a specific phrase that describes what the attribute does and what metadata it provides.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the attribute's purpose and usage.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2047
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2047
```
