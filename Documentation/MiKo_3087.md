# MiKo_3087: Do not use negative complex conditions

## Cause

A complex condition uses negative logic with multiple clauses.

## Rule description

Complex conditions with negative logic are difficult to understand, cumbersome, and error-prone.
Change them to positive logic to improve readability, simplify the code, and reduce errors.
This approach ensures the code is clear and easier to maintain.

### Rationale behind

Negative logic in complex conditions forces developers to think in double negatives and apply De Morgan's laws mentally.
This significantly increases the cognitive load required to understand the code and makes errors much more likely.

Using positive logic in complex conditions provides several important benefits:

- **Reduces Cognitive Load**:
  Positive logic is more intuitive and requires less mental effort to understand.
  Developers can read the condition and immediately grasp what is being checked without mental gymnastics.

- **Prevents Logic Errors**:
  Negative complex conditions are extremely error-prone.
  It is easy to make mistakes when combining multiple negations with AND or OR operators, and these errors are difficult to spot in code reviews.

- **Improves Code Clarity**:
  Positive conditions clearly state what is being looked for or validated.
  Negative conditions require developers to figure out what is being excluded, which is harder to reason about.

- **Simplifies Maintenance**:
  When conditions need to be modified, positive logic is much easier to work with.
  Adding or removing clauses from negated complex conditions often introduces subtle bugs.

- **Enables Better Testing**:
  Test cases for positive logic are more straightforward to write and understand.
  Testing negative complex conditions requires more careful thought to ensure all cases are covered.

- **Facilitates Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can verify positive logic much more quickly and accurately.
  Complex negative conditions require significantly more time and attention to review properly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, apply De Morgan's laws to convert the negative logic to positive logic.
Change `!(a && b)` to `!a || !b`, and `!(a || b)` to `!a && !b`.
Then restructure the code so that the positive condition is checked in the if statement and the else branch handles the alternative case.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3087
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3087
```
