# MiKo_1300: Name unimportant lambda parameters `_`

## Cause

A lambda parameter has a meaningful name instead of `_`.

## Rule description

Lambda parameters should be named `_` when the parameter name itself does not add meaningful information.
This is a common convention that clearly shows the parameter name is unimportant compared to what is being accessed from the parameter.

Lambda parameters such as `x`, `o`, or `mgr` do not provide meaningful information to the overall context.
Most times it is already clear what the parameter represents from the collection being processed.
The more important thing is what is done with the parameters.
Naming them `_` allows focusing on what is done with them more easily.

Consider this example that is difficult to read:

```csharp
var libraries = someLibraries.OrderBy(someLibrary => someLibrary.CompanyName)
                             .ThenBy(someLibrary => someLibrary.Title)
                             .ThenByDescending(someLibrary => someLibrary.Version);
```

When lambda parameters are named `_`, the code becomes easier to read:

```csharp
var libraries = someLibraries.OrderBy(_ => _.CompanyName)
                             .ThenBy(_ => _.Title)
                             .ThenByDescending(_ => _.Version);
```

The code can now be understood at a glance: libraries are ordered first by company name, then by title, and then by version.
Having to parse 'someLibrary => someLibrary.` each time is a waste of time and makes the code harder to understand.

The focus should be on the important parts: `CompanyName`, `Title`, and `Version`.
Same applies when attemping to parse `library => library.`, `l => l.` or  `x => x.`.

### Rationale behind

Using the underscore (`_`) for lambda parameters is a widely recognized convention that communicates what is important in the code.
It immediately signals to anyone reading the code that the parameter name itself is unimportant and the focus should be on what is being accessed or done with the parameter.

This convention provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Focus Indication**:
  The underscore immediately signals that the parameter name is not relevant to understanding the code.
  It directs attention to what matters: the properties, methods, or operations being performed.

- **Improved Scanning Efficiency**:
  Developers can quickly scan through lambda expressions without getting distracted by repetitive parameter names.
  The important information (what is being accessed or called) stands out immediately.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Using `_` instead of meaningful names reduces the amount of text developers need to parse.
  This makes the lambda's actual logic stand out more clearly.

- **Enhanced Focus on Important Parts**:
  When the parameter name is `_`, developers can immediately focus on what matters: the property access, method call, or operation being performed.
  Repetitive parameter names (like `library => library.` or 'someLibrary => someLibrary.`) add noise that obscures the actual logic.

- **Better Readability for Chained Operations**:
  In method chains (like LINQ queries), using `_` makes each operation more distinct and easier to scan.
  The pattern becomes consistent and predictable across the entire chain.

- **Prevention of Redundant Information**:
  When the collection name already indicates what type of items are being processed, repeating this information in parameter names is redundant.
  The underscore eliminates this redundancy while keeping the code concise.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  The convention makes the code self-documenting by using naming to convey semantic information about importance.
  Developers immediately understand that the focus should be on the accessed members, not the parameter itself.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename lambda parameters to `_`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1300
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1300
