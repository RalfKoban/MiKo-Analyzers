# MiKo_6058: Indent type parameter constraint clauses below parameter list

## Cause

Type parameter constraint clauses are not indented below the parameter list.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when type parameter constraint clauses are indented below the parameter list.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Proper indentation of type parameter constraint clauses is essential for maintaining clear code structure and visual hierarchy.
When constraint clauses are indented below the parameter list, it creates a clear visual separation between the method signature and the generic constraints, making the code structure immediately apparent.

Indenting type parameter constraint clauses below the parameter list provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**:
  Indentation establishes a visual hierarchy that shows constraint clauses are related to the method but are secondary to the parameter list.
  This helps developers understand the relationship between different parts of the method declaration.

- **Improved Readability**:
  When constraint clauses are indented, the method signature becomes easier to read.
  The parameter list and constraints are visually distinct, preventing the two from blending together into an unreadable block of code.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  Properly indented constraints make it easier to navigate through the code.
  Developers can quickly identify where the parameter list ends and the constraints begin.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Following a consistent indentation pattern for constraints creates uniformity across the codebase.
  This consistency makes the code more predictable and easier to work with.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Clear indentation helps prevent mistakes when adding or modifying constraints.
  The visual separation makes it obvious where constraints should be placed and how they should be formatted.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When code is properly indented, future modifications become simpler.
  Developers can easily add new constraints or modify existing ones without disrupting the code structure.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, indent the type parameter constraint clauses below the parameter list.
Ensure the constraint clauses are indented to clearly show they are subordinate to the method signature.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6058
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6058
```
