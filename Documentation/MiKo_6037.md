# MiKo_6037: Place single arguments on same line(s) as invoked methods

## Cause

Single arguments are placed on different lines than the invoked methods.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when single arguments are placed on the same lines as the invoked methods.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

When a method has only a single argument, splitting it across multiple lines creates unnecessary vertical space and makes the code harder to read.
The separation between the method name and its argument disrupts the natural flow of reading and understanding the code.

Placing single arguments on the same lines as invoked methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete method call fits on one line, making it immediately clear what is being called and with what argument.
  Developers can understand the entire operation at a glance without scanning multiple lines.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Keeping simple method calls on a single line minimizes the vertical space used by the code.
  This allows developers to see more code on the screen at once, making it easier to understand the overall structure and flow.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Single-argument method calls read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows the expected pattern that developers are familiar with and reduces cognitive load.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Treating single arguments consistently helps maintain a uniform codebase.
  Developers can quickly recognize simple method calls versus more complex multi-argument calls.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  When simple method calls are compact, it is easier to scan through code and find specific invocations.
  The reduced line count makes navigation and searching more efficient.

- **Better Use of Screen Space**:
  Horizontal space is often underutilized in code editors.
  Keeping single arguments on the same line as their methods makes better use of available screen space and reduces unnecessary scrolling.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the single argument to the same line as the invoked method.
Ensure that the method name, parentheses, and the single argument are all on one line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6037
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6037
```
