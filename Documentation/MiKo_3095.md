# MiKo_3095: Do not use empty code blocks

## Cause

A code block is empty and does not contain a comment explaining why.

## Rule description

Empty code blocks should include a comment explaining why they are empty.
This helps developers understand the reason and ensures the block is not empty by mistake.

### Rationale behind

Empty code blocks in source code can be confusing because it is not immediately clear whether the block is intentionally empty or was left incomplete by mistake.
Without explanation, empty blocks can lead to wasted time investigating whether they are bugs or intentional.

Requiring comments in empty code blocks provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Accidental Omissions**:
  Empty blocks without comments might indicate unfinished code or forgotten implementations.
  Requiring a comment forces developers to confirm that the empty block is intentional.

- **Documents Intent**:
  A comment in an empty block explains why no action is needed.
  This helps future developers understand that the empty block serves a purpose, such as satisfying an interface requirement or explicitly choosing not to handle a specific case.

- **Improves Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that empty blocks are intentional when they contain explanatory comments.
  Without comments, reviewers must investigate whether the empty block is correct or a mistake.

- **Aids Maintenance**:
  When code is maintained months or years later, comments in empty blocks help developers understand why no action was taken.
  This prevents unnecessary attempts to "fix" intentionally empty blocks.

- **Supports Debugging**:
  During debugging, developers encountering empty blocks with comments can immediately understand that no action is expected.
  This saves time that would otherwise be spent investigating whether the empty block is causing issues.

- **Follows Best Practices**:
  Well-commented code is a fundamental best practice in software development.
  Requiring comments for empty blocks extends this practice to a specific case where clarity is particularly important.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a comment inside the empty code block explaining why it is empty.
The comment should be meaningful and explain the reason, such as "Intentionally empty - interface requirement" or "No cleanup needed in this case".
If the block should not be empty, implement the missing functionality.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3095
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3095
```
