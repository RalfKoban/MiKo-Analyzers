# MiKo_1092: Do not suffix `Ability` types with redundant information

## Cause

A type name ending with an `ability` suffix (like `Comparable`) also contains redundant information.

## Rule description

Instead of suffixing an `ability` type with redundant information (such as `ComparableItem`), the redundant information should be left out of the name of the type (such as `Comparable`).

### Rationale behind

Redundant information in type names that already have an `ability` suffix creates unnecessary verbosity that makes code harder to read and maintain.
When a type implements an interface that defines an ability (like `IComparable` or `IDisposable`), the interface name already conveys the essential purpose.

Using concise type names without redundant information provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter type names are easier to read and understand.
  Developers can quickly grasp what the type does without having to parse through unnecessary words.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Following a consistent pattern of avoiding redundancy makes the codebase more predictable.
  This helps developers understand naming conventions and apply them correctly in their own code.

- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**:
  Shorter names are easier to refactor and less prone to typos.
  When types are renamed or moved, less typing is required and there is less chance of making mistakes.

- **Cleaner Code**:
  Concise type names result in cleaner, more professional-looking code.
  This makes the codebase more pleasant to work with and easier to review.

- **Focus on Core Concept**:
  Names that focus on the core ability (like `Comparable`) rather than adding redundant details communicate the type's purpose more directly.
  This helps developers understand what the type is for without getting distracted by unnecessary information.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the redundant information from the type name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1092
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1092
```
