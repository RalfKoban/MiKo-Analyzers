# MiKo_2051: Document thrown exceptions as conditions (e.g., `<paramref name="xyz"/> is <c>42</c>`)

## Cause

Exception documentation does not state the condition as a simple fact.

## Rule description

When documenting a thrown exception, use a simple condition phrase like: `The item is not available.` Avoid phrases like `Thrown if` or `throws if` since it is already clear that the exception is thrown under those conditions.
This keeps the documentation concise and to the point.

### Rationale behind

Exception documentation appears in `<exception>` tags, which already indicates that an exception is thrown.
Adding redundant phrases like `Thrown if` or `throws if` adds unnecessary words without providing additional information.
Stating the condition directly makes the documentation more concise and easier to read.

Documenting exceptions as simple conditions provides several important benefits:

- **Concise Documentation**:
  Eliminating redundant phrases like `Thrown if` makes exception documentation shorter and easier to read.
  Developers can quickly understand the exception conditions without reading unnecessary words.

- **Direct Communication**:
  Stating the condition directly is more assertive and clear than using conditional phrases.
  It tells developers exactly what state causes the exception.

- **Consistent with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET Framework typically documents exceptions as simple conditions, and following the same pattern makes the documentation feel more professional and aligned with .NET conventions.

- **Better Readability**:
  Simple conditional statements are easier to parse mentally than longer phrases.
  This improves the overall readability of the documentation.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Removing redundant phrases reduces documentation verbosity without losing any meaning.
  This makes the documentation more efficient and professional.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  When exception conditions are stated directly, developers can quickly scan through multiple exception entries and understand all the error cases.
  This saves time and improves productivity.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite exception documentation to state the condition as a simple fact.
Remove phrases like `Thrown if`, `throws if`, `Thrown when`, or `throws when`, and instead directly state the condition that causes the exception.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2051
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2051
```
