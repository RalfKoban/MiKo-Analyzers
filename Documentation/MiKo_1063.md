# MiKo_1063: Do not use abbreviations in names

## Cause

A name contains abbreviations.

## Rule description

Using abbreviations in names is bad practice.
It makes it difficult for new developers to understand the code.
Plus, abbreviations distract readers, as they have to constantly translate their meaning.

### Rationale behind

Abbreviations force developers to remember what each shortened term means, creating unnecessary mental overhead.
What seems obvious to the person who wrote the code might be confusing to someone else.
Different developers might use different abbreviations for the same concept, leading to inconsistency.

Avoiding abbreviations in names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Full words are immediately understandable without requiring mental translation.
  Developers can read the code naturally without stopping to decode abbreviations.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Abbreviations can have multiple meanings depending on context.
  Full words eliminate this ambiguity and make the intent crystal clear.

- **Better Onboarding**:
  New team members can understand the code faster when names are spelled out completely.
  Less time is spent asking what abbreviations mean.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When code is self-explanatory, it requires fewer comments and less documentation.
  Future maintainers can understand what the code does without external resources.

- **Consistency Across Team**:
  When everyone uses full words, there is no debate about which abbreviations are acceptable.
  The codebase remains consistent regardless of who writes the code.

- **Better Code Search**:
  Searching for full words in the codebase yields more accurate results.
  Developers do not need to remember or guess abbreviations when looking for specific functionality.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Code without abbreviations appears more polished and professional.
  It demonstrates attention to detail and care for code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace abbreviations with their full words.
