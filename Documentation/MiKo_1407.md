# MiKo_1407: Do not include `Test` in test namespaces

## Cause

A test namespace includes `Test` in its name.

## Rule description

Test project namespaces should mirror the structure of the code being tested without adding `Test` to namespace segments.
The fact that it's a test is already clear from the project structure.

### Rationale behind

Excluding `Test` from test namespaces creates a cleaner, more maintainable parallel structure between production and test code.
When test namespaces exactly mirror production namespaces, it becomes immediately obvious which test file corresponds to which production file.

Mirroring production namespaces without `Test` provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Navigation**:
  The parallel structure makes it simple to navigate between production and test code.
  If working on `MyApp.Services.UserService`, the tests are in `MyApp.Services` in the test project.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Finding and organizing tests becomes straightforward when they mirror production structure.
  Developers can quickly locate the tests for any production class.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The `Test` suffix in the project name already indicates that the code is test-related.
  Repeating this information in every namespace is unnecessary.

- **Simplified Refactoring**:
  When renaming namespaces, there is no need to remember to add or remove `Test` segments.
  The parallel structure reduces refactoring overhead.

- **Immediate Clarity**:
  Developers can instantly understand which test file corresponds to which production file.
  This improves productivity and reduces confusion.

- **Enhanced Professionalism**:
  The clean parallel structure improves the overall professionalism of the codebase.
  It shows attention to detail and adherence to best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove `Test` from the namespace. This also applies for names such as `UnitTests` or `IntegrationTests`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1407
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1407
```
