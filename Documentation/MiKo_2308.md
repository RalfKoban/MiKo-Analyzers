# MiKo_2308: Place comments after code instead of on single line before closing brace

## Cause

A comment appears on a single line immediately before a closing brace instead of after the code it describes.

## Rule description

Comments typically describe something related to an operation.
Therefore, they should be placed before the operation, not after.
This placement ensures that the reader can easily associate the comment with the corresponding operation, eliminating any guesswork about their relation and keeping everything clear and straightforward.

### Rationale behind

When a comment appears alone on a line before a closing brace, it is unclear what the comment refers to.
It could describe the operation above it, the closing of the scope, or something else entirely.
This ambiguity creates confusion and wastes developers` time.

Placing comments appropriately provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  When comments appear before the code they describe, the relationship is clear.
  Comments floating before closing braces create uncertainty about what they document.

- **Improves Readability**:
  Comments that clearly precede their related code are easier to read and understand.
  Developers can follow the flow of explanation to implementation naturally.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  A comment before a closing brace could be interpreted in multiple ways.
  Proper placement ensures there is only one correct interpretation.

- **Better Code Structure**:
  Well-placed comments contribute to better overall code organization.
  They help create logical sections that are easy to navigate.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  When comments are clearly associated with specific code, developers can understand the code faster.
  They do not need to puzzle out what the comment refers to.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Properly placed comments demonstrate attention to detail and understanding of good commenting practices.
  This reflects positively on code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move comments from before closing braces to before the code they describe.
If a comment truly describes the closing of a scope, consider whether it is necessary at all.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2308
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2308
```
