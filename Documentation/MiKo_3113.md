# MiKo_3113: Do not use FluentAssertions

## Cause

A test method uses FluentAssertions library instead of NUnit's fluent assertion approach.

## Rule description

FluentAssertions uses a `Should` method followed by the assertion, which can make assertions harder to read and spot.
In contrast, NUnit's fluent assertion approach using `Assert.That` is easier to spot and read.
This makes NUnit's approach more user-friendly and accessible.

### Rationale behind

Consistency in assertion styles across a test suite improves maintainability and reduces cognitive load.
When all tests use the same assertion framework, developers can work more efficiently without context switching.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Better Visual Recognition**:
  `Assert.That` statements are easy to spot when scanning test code.
  The `Should` extension methods blend in with regular method calls, making assertions less visible.

- **Reduced Dependencies**:
  Relying on NUnit's built-in assertions eliminates the need for an additional library.
  Fewer dependencies mean simpler project setup and reduced maintenance burden.

- **Improved Consistency**:
  Using one assertion style throughout the test suite creates a uniform codebase.
  Developers do not need to switch mental models between different assertion syntaxes.

- **Easier Onboarding**:
  New team members only need to learn one assertion framework.
  This reduces the learning curve and helps developers become productive faster.

- **Better IDE Support**:
  NUnit assertions are well-supported in Visual Studio and other development tools.
  Standard framework features often have better tooling integration than third-party libraries.

- **Simpler Migration**:
  Tests using standard NUnit assertions are easier to migrate to newer versions or different test frameworks.
  Custom assertion libraries can create lock-in and complicate future changes.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace FluentAssertions methods with NUnit's `Assert.That` and appropriate constraints.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3113
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3113
```
