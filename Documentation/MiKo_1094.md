# MiKo_1094: Do not suffix types with passive namespace names

## Cause

A type name ends with a passive suffix like `Management` or `Handling`.

## Rule description

Types should have active suffixes that clearly identify them as types.
Avoid using passive suffixes like `Management` or `Handling` and opt for more active terms like `Manager` or `Handler`.

Keep the passive suffixes for namespaces.

### Rationale behind

Passive suffixes like `Management` or `Handling` are typically used for namespaces that group related types together.
When these suffixes appear on type names, they create confusion about whether something is a namespace or a type.
Active suffixes like `Manager` or `Handler` clearly indicate that the name refers to a concrete type that performs actions.

Using active suffixes for types provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Active suffixes make it immediately clear that a name refers to a type rather than a namespace.
  This reduces confusion when reading code and makes it easier to understand the code structure.

- **Better Readability**:
  Names with active suffixes read more naturally in code.
  For example, `UserManager.CreateUser()` is more intuitive than `UserManagement.CreateUser()` because it suggests an object that manages users.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Active suffixes communicate that the type performs specific actions.
  This helps developers understand what the type is responsible for and how it should be used.

- **Consistent Conventions**:
  Following the convention of using passive suffixes for namespaces and active suffixes for types creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes it easier for developers to navigate and understand the code structure.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Clear distinction between namespace names and type names makes it easier to organize code into logical groups.
  This improves the overall architecture and makes the codebase easier to maintain.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the passive suffix to an active one.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1094
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1094
```
