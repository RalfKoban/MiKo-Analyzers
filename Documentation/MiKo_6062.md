# MiKo_6062: Place expressions within complex initializer expressions beside open brace

## Cause

Expressions within complex initializer expressions are not positioned beside the opening brace.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when expressions within complex initializer expressions are indented right beside the opening braces.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Positioning expressions beside the opening brace in complex initializers is crucial for maintaining clear code structure and visual flow.
When the first expression starts immediately after the opening brace rather than on a new line, it creates a more compact and readable initialization block that is easier to comprehend.

Placing expressions within complex initializer expressions beside the open brace provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Compactness**:
  Starting expressions beside the opening brace reduces unnecessary vertical space.
  This makes initializers more compact while still maintaining readability.

- **Better Visual Flow**:
  The brace and first expression on the same line creates a natural visual flow.
  Developers can immediately see that the brace opens an initialization block without having to scan to the next line.

- **Reduced Vertical Scrolling**:
  More compact initializers mean less scrolling is required to see the entire initialization.
  This helps developers understand the complete initialization without losing context.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  When expressions consistently start beside the opening brace, the code follows a predictable pattern.
  This consistency makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

- **Clear Structure Recognition**:
  The format makes it immediately obvious where initialization blocks begin and end.
  The opening brace with its first expression acts as a clear marker of the initialization start.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  The compact format is easier to read because it groups related elements together.
  Developers can see the opening brace and the start of the initialization in one glance.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the first expression of the complex initializer on the same line as the opening brace.
Ensure that subsequent expressions follow appropriate indentation rules while keeping the first expression beside the brace.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6062
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6062
```
