# MiKo_3030: Follow Law of Demeter in methods

## Cause

A method chains multiple property or method calls on objects.

## Rule description

To ease maintenance, methods should make minimal assumptions about the structure or properties of the objects they use.
They should work only with objects they receive directly and avoid reaching through these objects to access other objects or their services.
This practice keeps methods focused, modular, and easier to maintain.

### Rationale behind

Following the [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) reduces coupling between different parts of the codebase, making the system more flexible and easier to change.
When code depends on the internal structure of objects it does not own, changes to those internal structures can cause widespread breaking changes.

Adhering to the Law of Demeter provides several important benefits:

- **Reduced Coupling**:
  Methods only interact with immediate dependencies, not with the dependencies of dependencies.
  This minimizes the number of components that need to change when one component is modified.

- **Improved Testability**:
  Code that follows the Law of Demeter is easier to test because it has fewer dependencies.
  Mock objects and test doubles can be created more easily when methods only interact with direct collaborators.

- **Better Encapsulation**:
  Internal structures of objects remain hidden from code that should not need to know about them.
  This preserves the ability to change implementation details without affecting other parts of the system.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  When methods make fewer assumptions about object structures, refactoring becomes safer and simpler.
  Changes to one class are less likely to require changes throughout the codebase.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code that respects boundaries between objects is easier to understand and modify.
  Developers can reason about individual components without needing to understand the entire object graph.

- **Clearer Dependencies**:
  When methods only use objects they receive directly, the dependencies of a class become more obvious.
  This makes it easier to understand what a class needs to function properly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, avoid chaining multiple property or method calls.
Instead, have the immediate object provide the needed functionality directly, or pass the required object as a parameter.
Refactor long call chains into simpler interactions that respect object boundaries.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3030
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3030
```
