# MiKo_3050: Declare `DependencyProperty` fields as `public static readonly`

## Cause

A `DependencyProperty` field is not declared as `public static readonly`.

## Rule description

Fields that are the back of a `DependencyProperty` should be made `public static readonly` to allow the .NET framework and other clients to find and access those fields.

### Rationale behind

Dependency properties are a fundamental part of the WPF property system, providing support for data binding, styling, and animation.
The WPF framework and other tools need to discover and access dependency property fields to enable these features.

Declaring dependency properties as public static readonly provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Requirements**:
  WPF requires dependency properties to be public and static so it can discover them through reflection.
  Non-public properties cannot be used in XAML or accessed by the property system.

- **Proper Semantics**:
  Dependency properties are metadata that should never change after initialization.
  The `readonly` modifier enforces this immutability, preventing accidental modifications.

- **Convention Adherence**:
  `public static readonly` is the [established convention for dependency properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/properties/how-to-implement-a-dependency-property) across the .NET ecosystem.
  Following conventions makes code immediately recognizable and understandable to other developers.

- **Tool Support**:
  Design tools and property inspectors rely on dependency properties being discoverable.
  Proper accessibility ensures these tools can provide features like property editing and binding support.

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  Static fields ensure only one instance exists per type, not per object instance.
  This is critical for dependency properties, which define property metadata shared across all instances.

- **Registration Validation**:
  The WPF property system validates that dependency property fields follow the correct pattern.
  Incorrect modifiers can cause registration failures or runtime errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure the `DependencyProperty` field is declared as `public static readonly`.
Change the accessibility to `public`, add the `static` modifier, and add the `readonly` modifier.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3050
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3050
```
