# MiKo_1049: Do not use requirement terms such as `Shall`, `Should`, `Must` or `Need` for names

## Cause

A name uses requirement terms like `Must`, `Need`, `Shall`, `Should`, `Will`, or `Would`.

## Rule description

Using terms like `Must`, `Need`, `Shall`, `Should`, `Will`, or `Would` in names is not clear enough.
Instead, go for positive verbs or adjectives like `Is`, `Has`, or `Can`.
These make the names more explicit and easier to understand.

Requirement terms create ambiguity and do not clearly indicate what the member does or represents.
Using clear, direct language improves code readability.

### Rationale behind

Requirement terms like `Should` or `Must` come from requirements specifications and do not translate well into code.
They create uncertainty about what the code actually does.
Direct, positive language makes the purpose of code members immediately clear.

Avoiding requirement terms in names provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Intent**:
  A method named `CanExecute` is clearer than `ShouldExecute`.
  The first directly states what it checks, while the second is ambiguous about its purpose.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Terms like `Should` and `Must` can mean different things in different contexts.
  Direct verbs like `Is`, `Has`, and `Can` have clear, unambiguous meanings.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Code reads more naturally with direct language.
  `if (user.HasPermission())` is clearer than `if (user.ShouldHavePermission())`.

- **Better Code Comprehension**:
  Developers do not need to interpret what `Should` or `Must` means in the context of the code.
  Direct language removes this mental translation step.

- **Consistency with .NET Standards**:
  The .NET Framework uses direct, positive language in its APIs.
  Methods like `CanRead`, `HasValue`, and `IsValid` are common, while `ShouldRead` or `MustValidate` are not used.

- **Clearer Boolean Logic**:
  Boolean properties and methods work better with direct language.
  `IsEnabled` is more natural than `ShouldBeEnabled` when used in conditions.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Direct, clear naming is a hallmark of professional code.
  Avoiding vague requirement terms makes the code appear more polished and well-designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the member to use direct, positive language instead of requirement terms.

Replace `Should` with `Is` or `Can`, replace `Must` with `Has` or `Is`, and replace `Need` with `Requires` or a more specific verb.

For example, rename `ShouldProcess` to `CanProcess`, `MustValidate` to `IsValid`, or `NeedsUpdate` to `RequiresUpdate`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1049
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1049
```
