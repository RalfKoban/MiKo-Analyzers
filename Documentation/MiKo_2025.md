# MiKo_2025: Start `CancellationToken` parameter documentation with default phrase

## Cause

Documentation for a `CancellationToken` parameter does not start with the standard phrase.

## Rule description

Documentation for `CancellationToken` parameters should begin with a phrase that outlines its usage, like: `The token to monitor for cancellation requests.`
This keeps the documentation clear and consistent, aiding developers in understanding its purpose.

### Rationale behind

`CancellationToken` is a standard .NET type used for cooperative cancellation in asynchronous operations.
Its purpose and usage pattern are well-established, so documentation should follow a consistent format that developers recognize.

Using the standard `CancellationToken` documentation phrase provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework and most libraries use the phrase `The token to monitor for cancellation requests` for `CancellationToken` parameters.
  Following the same convention creates immediate familiarity for developers.

- **Clear Purpose Statement**:
  The standard phrase clearly explains what the parameter does without requiring lengthy explanations.
  Developers immediately understand how the token will be used.

- **Established Pattern**:
  `CancellationToken` has a well-known purpose in .NET asynchronous programming.
  Using standard documentation leverages developers` existing knowledge about how cancellation tokens work.

- **Reduced Documentation**:
  Because `CancellationToken` usage is standardized, there is no need for detailed explanations in every method.
  The standard phrase provides sufficient information for developers familiar with async patterns.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Following the same documentation style as the .NET Framework makes custom async methods look professional and well-designed.
  This builds confidence in the API quality.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  Consistent `CancellationToken` documentation across all methods creates a predictable IntelliSense experience.
  Developers know exactly what to expect when they see this parameter.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the `CancellationToken` parameter documentation to use the standard phrase.

Use: `The token to monitor for cancellation requests.` or a similar variant like `The cancellation token to observe.` if appropriate for the context.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2025
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2025
```
