# MiKo_2037: Start command property `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A command property `<summary>` documentation does not start with the default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation for a property that returns a command should begin with a phrase that clearly describes what the command does, making the documentation more helpful and precise for developers.

### Rationale behind

Command properties are used extensively in MVVM and similar patterns to represent actions that can be invoked from the user interface.
Using a consistent starting phrase for command property documentation helps developers quickly identify and understand the action that the command represents.

Following a standard format for command property documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Command Purpose**:
  Starting command property documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear what action the command performs.
  Developers can quickly understand the command's functionality without having to examine the implementation.

- **Consistent MVVM Documentation**:
  Using a standard phrase for command properties creates uniformity in MVVM-based codebases.
  This consistency helps developers navigate and understand the application's command structure.

- **Better UI Understanding**:
  Command properties are typically bound to UI elements, and clear documentation helps developers understand what happens when a user interacts with the UI.
  This improves the overall understanding of the application's behavior.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Consistent command documentation makes it easier to maintain and update commands.
  Changes to command behavior can be tracked more easily when documentation follows a predictable pattern.

- **Faster Development**:
  When command documentation is clear and consistent, developers can work faster because they do not need to spend time figuring out what each command does.
  This improves productivity and reduces development time.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the command property documentation with a phrase that clearly describes what the command does.
Ensure the phrase makes it clear that the property returns a command and what action that command performs.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2037
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2037
```
