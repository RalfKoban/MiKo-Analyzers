# MiKo_3114: Use `Mock.Of<T>()` instead of `new Mock<T>().Object`

## Cause

A test method uses `new Mock<T>().Object` instead of `Mock.Of<T>()` to create a mock object.

## Rule description

Use `Mock.Of<T>()` in tests instead of `new Mock<T>().Object`.
This makes it easier to spot necessary but unimportant mocks and keeps the code cleaner and easier to read.

### Rationale behind

Creating mock objects is a common task in unit testing, but not all mocks require complex setup or verification.
Using the most concise syntax for simple mocks improves test readability and clearly communicates which mocks are important.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  `Mock.Of<T>()` is shorter and more concise than `new Mock<T>().Object`.
  Less code means tests are easier to read and understand at a glance.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  `Mock.Of<T>()` signals that the mock is a simple dependency with no special setup.
  The longer syntax suggests that setup or verification might be needed, even when it is not.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Shorter mock creation syntax makes test setup sections more compact.
  Developers can see all dependencies at once without scrolling through verbose initialization code.

- **Better Focus on Important Details**:
  When simple mocks are concise, complex mocks that require setup stand out more clearly.
  This helps developers quickly identify which dependencies have important test behavior.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Using `Mock.Of<T>()` consistently for simple mocks creates a recognizable pattern.
  Developers can immediately distinguish between simple and complex mock usage.

- **Less Code Maintenance**:
  Fewer lines of code mean less code to maintain and update.
  Simple mocks created with `Mock.Of<T>()` are less likely to be accidentally modified or extended.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `new Mock<T>().Object` with `Mock.Of<T>()`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3114
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3114
```
