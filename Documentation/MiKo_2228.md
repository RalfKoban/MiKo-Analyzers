# MiKo_2228: Use positive wording instead of negative in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation uses negative wording like "not" or "cannot" instead of positive phrasing.

## Rule description

Negative wording can be confusing, especially when combined with other negative terms (for example, "This cannot be done if it is not empty").
Positive wording is clearer and more direct, making the documentation straightforward and to the point.
This approach enhances readability and comprehension, helping developers easily grasp the information.

### Rationale behind

Negative wording, particularly double negatives, forces readers to process the meaning in multiple steps.
This increases cognitive load and slows down comprehension.
Positive wording communicates the same information more efficiently and reduces the chance of misunderstanding.

Using positive wording in documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  Positive statements are processed more quickly by the brain than negative ones.
  Developers can understand the documentation faster and get back to writing code sooner.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When documentation uses complex negative phrasing, developers are more likely to misinterpret the meaning.
  This can lead to bugs and incorrect usage.
  Positive wording reduces these errors.

- **Better Clarity**:
  Positive statements clearly communicate what is true or what should be done.
  Negative statements require readers to infer what is true from what is false, adding unnecessary complexity.

- **Easier Translation**:
  For non-native English speakers, positive phrasing is typically easier to understand than negative constructions.
  This makes documentation more accessible to international teams.

- **Avoids Double Negatives**:
  When negative terms are combined, the meaning can become very confusing.
  Positive wording eliminates this problem entirely.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Clear, positive documentation demonstrates careful attention to how information is communicated.
  This reflects well on the overall code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rephrase documentation to use positive wording instead of negative constructions.
Focus on stating what is true rather than what is not true.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2228
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2228
