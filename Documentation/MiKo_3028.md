# MiKo_3028: Do not assign `null` to lambda parameters

## Cause

Code assigns `null` to a lambda expression parameter.

## Rule description

To clear a collection, use `Clear()`.
Assigning `null` to a parameter will not work because the parameter is just a copy (reference) of the original.
`Clear()` effectively empties the collection, maintaining clarity and correct functionality.
Keeps everything working as expected.

### Rationale behind

Assigning `null` to parameters in lambda expressions does not achieve the intended effect.
Parameters are passed by value (even for reference types), so assigning `null` only changes the local copy, not the original.

Avoiding `null` assignments to lambda parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Correct Behavior**:
  Assigning `null` to a parameter does not affect the original object.
  Using methods like `Clear()` actually modifies the collection as intended.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Calling `Clear()` explicitly communicates the intention to empty a collection.
  Assigning `null` suggests a misunderstanding of how parameters work.

- **Prevents Bugs**:
  Code that assigns `null` to parameters appears to work but has no effect.
  This creates subtle bugs that are hard to diagnose.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  Developers reading the code might be confused by `null` assignments that do nothing.
  Using proper methods makes the code's purpose clear.

- **Follows Best Practices**:
  Modifying objects through their methods is the standard approach.
  Parameter reassignment is generally discouraged in .NET development.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use the `Clear()` method on collections instead of assigning `null` to the parameter.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3028
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3028
```
