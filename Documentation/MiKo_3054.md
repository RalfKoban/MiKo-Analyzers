# MiKo_3054: Expose `DependencyProperty` identifier for read-only DependencyProperties

## Cause

A read-only dependency property defined by a `DependencyPropertyKey` does not expose a public `DependencyProperty` identifier.

## Rule description

Read-only dependency properties are defined by `DependencyPropertyKey` fields and should remain non-public.
To make them accessible, expose a dependency property identifier for the read-only property.
Do this by exposing the value of `DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty` as a `public static readonly` field in the specific class.
This maintains encapsulation while allowing access to the property.

### Rationale behind

Read-only dependency properties need to be discoverable by the WPF framework and development tools while preventing external code from modifying them.
The pattern of keeping the key private while exposing the property achieves both goals.

Exposing dependency property identifiers provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Discovery**:
  WPF needs access to the `DependencyProperty` to support data binding and styling.
  Without a public identifier, the property cannot be used in XAML or accessed by the property system.

- **Tool Support**:
  Design tools and property inspectors need to discover properties through reflection.
  Public identifiers enable these tools to provide features like property editing and documentation.

- **Read-Only Enforcement**:
  The key remains private, preventing external code from setting the property.
  Only code with access to the key can modify the property value.

- **Metadata Access**:
  The public identifier provides access to property metadata without exposing write access.
  This allows querying default values, change callbacks, and validation logic.

- **Binding Support**:
  Data bindings in XAML can read the property value using the public identifier.
  Without it, the property would be invisible to the binding system.

- **Convention Compliance**:
  This pattern is the standard approach for read-only dependency properties in WPF.
  Following conventions makes code predictable and easier for other developers to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a `public static readonly DependencyProperty` field.
Initialize it with the value from `DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty`.
Name the field following the convention of appending "Property" to the CLR property wrapper name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3054
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3054
```
