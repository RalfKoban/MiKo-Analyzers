# MiKo_2213: Do not use contraction "n't" in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses a contraction ending in "n't" (like "don't", "can't", "won't").

## Rule description

Sometimes, contractions are missed, causing unintentional errors.
To prevent this, it is best to avoid them entirely.

### Rationale behind

Contractions with "n't" are informal and can be missed during proofreading or editing, potentially creating confusing or incorrect documentation.
Professional technical documentation should use the full forms of words for clarity and formality.

When contractions are used inconsistently, documentation can appear unpolished or carelessly written.
Using complete words ensures consistency and maintains a professional tone throughout the documentation.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Professionalism**:
  Full words like "do not" instead of "don't" create more formal, professional documentation.

- **Better Clarity**:
  Complete words are clearer and less prone to misreading than contractions.

- **Consistent Tone**:
  Avoiding contractions maintains a consistent formal tone throughout documentation.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Full words are less likely to be accidentally misspelled or misread than contractions.

- **Enhanced Accessibility**:
  Complete words are easier to understand for non-native English speakers and translation tools.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace contractions with their full forms (e.g., "don't" becomes "do not", "can't" becomes "cannot").

## How to suppress violations
