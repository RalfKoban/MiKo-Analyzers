# MiKo_6068: Place property patterns inside `if` conditions on same line

## Cause

Property patterns inside `if` conditions span multiple lines.

## Rule description

In C#, write simple property patterns on one line to keep code clean and easy to read.
This avoids extra indentation and makes it clear what is being checked.

### Rationale behind

Keeping property patterns on a single line within `if` conditions is important for maintaining concise and readable code.
When simple property patterns are unnecessarily split across multiple lines, they create visual clutter and make the condition harder to understand, especially when the pattern itself is straightforward.

Placing property patterns inside `if` conditions on the same line provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Single-line property patterns are easier to read and understand at a glance.
  Developers can immediately see what property is being checked and what condition is being tested.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Keeping patterns on one line reduces unnecessary vertical space and visual noise.
  This makes the code more compact and easier to scan.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  When the entire pattern fits on one line, the intent of the condition is immediately obvious.
  There is no need to piece together information from multiple lines.

- **Better Code Density**:
  Single-line patterns allow more code to be visible on the screen at once.
  This helps developers understand the broader context without excessive scrolling.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Simple patterns on single lines create consistency throughout the codebase.
  This makes the code more predictable and professional-looking.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Compact property patterns are easier to modify or refactor.
  The single-line format makes it clear what needs to be changed and reduces formatting errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the entire property pattern on a single line within the `if` condition.
Combine all parts of the pattern check onto one line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6068
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6068
```
