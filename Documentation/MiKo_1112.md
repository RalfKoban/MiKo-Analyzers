# MiKo_1112: Do not name test data `arbitrary`

## Cause

Test data is named `arbitrary` or contains `arbitrary` in its name.

## Rule description

In tests, the term `arbitrary` adds no real value to field, parameter, or variable names since test data is inherently arbitrary.
Removing it keeps the names simpler and just as clear.

### Rationale behind

Avoiding the term `arbitrary` in test data names is important for test clarity and maintainability.

Since test data is inherently arbitrary, using `arbitrary` in names provides several disadvantages:

- **Redundant Information**:
  Test data is by definition arbitrary - it's chosen to represent scenarios, not real production data.
  Stating this fact in the variable name adds no value and just makes names longer without improving clarity.

- **Missed Opportunity for Clarity**:
  Instead of stating the obvious (`arbitrary`), variable names should describe what the value represents or why it was chosen.
  `name` or `userName` tells you much more than `arbitraryName`.

- **Visual Clutter**:
  The word `arbitrary` adds unnecessary noise to test code.
  Removing it makes tests cleaner and easier to scan, allowing developers to focus on the actual test logic rather than redundant labels.

- **False Implication**:
  Using `arbitrary` might suggest the value truly does not matter, when in fact most test values are carefully chosen for specific reasons (boundary conditions, typical values, edge cases, etc.).
  This can mislead other developers about the test's intent.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Descriptive names explain why specific values are used in a test, making it easier to understand what the test validates.
  `userName` is much more informative than `arbitraryName`.

- **Improved Debugging**:
  When a test fails, meaningful variable names help developers quickly understand what went wrong and what values were involved.
  This significantly speeds up troubleshooting.

- **Better Code Documentation**:
  Well-named test data serves as inline documentation that explains the test scenario without requiring additional comments.
  This makes tests more self-explanatory.

- **Easier Test Maintenance**:
  When someone needs to update or refactor a test, descriptive names make it clear how test data is used and what changes might be needed.

- **More Professional Code**:
  Meaningful naming demonstrates care and attention to detail, making the codebase feel more polished and professional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove `arbitrary` from the test data name and use a more descriptive name that explains what the value represents or why it was chosen.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1112
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1112
