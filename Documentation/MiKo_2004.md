# MiKo_2004: Follow .NET Framework Design Guidelines for event handler parameter names in documentation

## Cause

Event handler parameter documentation does not follow the naming conventions specified in the .NET Framework Design Guidelines.

## Rule description

Event handler parameter names should adhere to the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for event handlers.
They should clearly define their purpose, making the documentation straightforward and easy to understand.

### Rationale behind

The .NET Framework Design Guidelines specify that event handlers should have two parameters: `sender` and `e`.
Following this convention in documentation ensures consistency with the broader .NET ecosystem and helps developers understand event handler patterns immediately.

Adhering to these guidelines provides several important benefits:

- **Universal Recognition**:
  The `sender` and `e` parameter names are universally recognized in .NET development.
  Developers instantly understand what these parameters represent without reading detailed documentation.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  All .NET Framework events follow this pattern.
  Using the same convention makes custom events feel like native framework events, reducing cognitive load for developers.

- **Clear Responsibilities**:
  The `sender` parameter represents the object that raised the event, while `e` contains event-specific data.
  This separation of concerns is immediately apparent when standard names are used.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Code reviewers can quickly verify that event handlers are implemented correctly when standard parameter names and documentation are used.
  Deviations from the pattern stand out immediately.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When documentation describes parameters using standard names, developers get consistent guidance across all events in the application.
  This reduces confusion and speeds up development.

- **Simplified Learning**:
  New developers learning event-driven programming can rely on consistent patterns throughout the codebase.
  They do not need to learn different naming conventions for different parts of the application.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the event handler parameter documentation to use the standard parameter names and descriptions.

Document the first parameter as `sender` (the source of the event) and the second parameter as `e` (an object that contains the event data).

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2004
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2004
```
