# MiKo_3081: Use pattern matching instead of logical NOT conditions

## Cause

A condition uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) with a boolean expression instead of pattern matching.

## Rule description

Logical NOT conditions using `!` can be hard to recognize.
Use `is false` instead; it is easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

The logical NOT operator (`!`) is a small symbol that can be easily overlooked when reading code, especially in complex conditions.
This can lead to misunderstanding the logic and introducing bugs when modifying conditions.

Using pattern matching for negation provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Readability**:
  The pattern `is false` uses words instead of symbols, making the negation explicit and obvious.
  Developers do not need to scan carefully for the small `!` symbol.

- **Reduces Cognitive Load**:
  Reading `value is false` requires less mental processing than `!value`.
  The intent is immediately clear without needing to parse operator precedence or notice small symbols.

- **Prevents Overlooking Negation**:
  The `!` operator is easy to miss, especially in longer expressions or when code is viewed quickly.
  Using `is false` makes the negation impossible to overlook.

- **Maintains Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching for boolean checks creates consistency with other pattern matching usage in modern C#.
  This makes the code style more uniform.

- **Simplifies Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can more easily spot logic errors when negation is explicit.
  Missing a `!` operator during review is much more likely than missing the word `false`.

- **Improves Accessibility**:
  For developers using screen readers or other assistive technologies, words are more accessible than symbols.
  This makes the code more inclusive.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `!condition` with `condition is false`.
For nullable booleans, use `condition is not true` to properly handle null values, or `condition is false` if null values should be treated differently.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3081
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3081
```
