# MiKo_3046: Use `nameof` for property names in property raising methods

## Cause

Property raising methods use string literals instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

Use the `nameof` operator instead of strings to define the properties for event raising methods like `OnPropertyChanged`.
This prevents typos, ensures valid names, and makes rename refactoring much easier, as `nameof` ensures property names are automatically updated during renames, unlike strings.

### Rationale behind

Methods that raise property change notifications are called from property setters throughout a class.
Using string literals for property names in these calls creates maintenance problems and opportunities for errors.

Using `nameof` for property raising methods provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Verification**:
  The compiler ensures that referenced properties exist.
  String literals can become outdated when properties are renamed or deleted.

- **Refactoring Safety**:
  Property renames automatically update all `nameof` references in raising method calls.
  String literals remain unchanged, breaking change notifications silently.

- **Reduced Copy-Paste Errors**:
  When property setters are copied and modified, `nameof` ensures the correct property is referenced.
  String literals often remain unchanged from the copied code, causing wrong properties to raise change notifications.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  Developers get autocomplete when using `nameof`, reducing typing and preventing errors.
  String literals require manual typing of property names without IDE assistance.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When change notifications do not work, `nameof` makes it obvious which property is being notified.
  String literals might not match property names due to typos or outdated code.

- **Consistent Patterns**:
  Using `nameof` throughout the codebase establishes a consistent approach to property notifications.
  This makes the code more predictable and easier to maintain.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace string literals with the `nameof` operator.
Change `OnPropertyChanged("PropertyName")` to `OnPropertyChanged(nameof(PropertyName))`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3046
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3046
```
