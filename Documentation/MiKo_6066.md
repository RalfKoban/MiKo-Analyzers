# MiKo_6066: Indent rather than outdent collection expression elements

## Cause

Elements of collection expressions are outdented rather than indented.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when elements of collection expressions are vertically indented.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Indenting collection expression elements is essential for maintaining clear code structure and visual hierarchy.
When elements are properly indented rather than outdented, it creates a clear visual grouping that shows which elements belong to the collection, making the code structure immediately apparent and easier to understand.

Indenting rather than outdenting collection expression elements provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Grouping**:
  Indentation shows that elements are contained within the collection.
  The visual grouping makes it immediately obvious which items belong together.

- **Better Readability**:
  Indented elements are easier to read because the structure is clear.
  Developers can quickly understand what items are part of the collection without having to analyze the code carefully.

- **Improved Code Structure Visibility**:
  Proper indentation makes the boundaries of the collection obvious.
  The indented elements are clearly distinguished from the surrounding code.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
  Indentation follows standard coding conventions for showing containment and hierarchy.
  This consistency makes the code more predictable and easier to work with.

- **Easier Modification**:
  When elements are indented, adding or removing items from the collection is straightforward.
  The clear structure reduces the risk of errors during modifications.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Properly indented collection expressions are easier to maintain over time.
  The clear visual structure makes it simple to understand and modify the collection when needed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, indent the collection expression elements rather than outdenting them.
Ensure each element is indented to show it is contained within the collection.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6066
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6066
```
