# MiKo_2054: Start `ArgumentException` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

An `ArgumentException` documentation does not start with the default phrase.

## Rule description

When documenting an `ArgumentException` being thrown, the documentation should start with the specific phrase: `<paramref name="value"/> is ...`.
This approach ensures clarity and consistency, helping developers understand the condition under which the exception is thrown.

### Rationale behind

`ArgumentException` is thrown when an argument value is invalid for reasons other than being null (which would be `ArgumentNullException`).
Using a consistent starting phrase for `ArgumentException` documentation makes it immediately clear which parameter has an invalid value and leads naturally into describing why the value is invalid.

Using the default phrase for `ArgumentException` documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Consistent Exception Documentation**:
  Using the same starting phrase across the codebase creates uniformity in how `ArgumentException` is documented.
  Developers know exactly what to expect when they see this exception type.

- **Clear Parameter Identification**:
  Starting with the parameter reference immediately identifies which argument is invalid.
  This helps developers quickly locate and fix argument validation issues.

- **Aligned with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET Framework uses similar phrasing for `ArgumentException` documentation, and following the same pattern makes the codebase feel more professional and aligned with .NET conventions.

- **Natural Flow to Condition**:
  Starting with the parameter name leads naturally into describing what makes the value invalid.
  This creates a logical documentation flow that is easy to read.

- **Reduced Documentation Errors**:
  Following a standard template reduces the likelihood of documentation errors or unclear wording.
  The documentation follows a proven pattern.

- **Better API Understanding**:
  Consistent `ArgumentException` documentation helps developers understand parameter validation requirements.
  This improves the overall API usability.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the `ArgumentException` documentation to start with the phrase `<paramref name="value"/> is ...` where `value` is replaced with the actual parameter name.
Complete the phrase by describing what makes the argument invalid.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2054
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2054
```
