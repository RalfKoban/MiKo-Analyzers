# MiKo_1017: Do not prefix methods with `Get` or `Set` when followed by `Is`, `Can` or `Has`

## Cause

A method name starts with `Get` or `Set` and is followed by `Is`, `Can`, or `Has`.

## Rule description

Avoid using `Get` or `Set` at the beginning of method names if the method already starts with `Is`, `Can` or `Has`.
The `Get` or `Set` is unnecessary and makes the name longer without adding value.

Method names like `GetIsValid` or `SetCanExecute` are awkward and redundant.
The `Is`, `Can`, or `Has` prefix already indicates the method's purpose clearly.

### Rationale behind

Removing redundant `Get` or `Set` prefixes from methods that start with `Is`, `Can`, or `Has` eliminates awkward double-verb constructions that hurt readability.
Names like `GetIsValid` or `SetCanExecute` sound unnatural and create unnecessary cognitive overhead.
The prefixes `Is`, `Can`, and `Has` are already action verbs that clearly indicate the method's purpose - `IsValid` asks a question, `CanExecute` queries capability, `HasItems` checks for existence.

Adding `Get` or `Set` before these prefixes creates redundancy that makes names longer without improving clarity.
This is similar to saying "get the is-valid status" when "is valid" already asks the question directly.
Clean, direct method names improve code readability and feel more natural when read as English phrases.

Following this guideline provides several important benefits:

- **Natural Language Flow**:
  Direct names like `IsValid` read naturally as questions.
  `GetIsValid` sounds awkward and unnatural, reducing code readability.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  `Is`, `Can`, and `Has` are already action verbs.
  Adding `Get` or `Set` creates unnecessary repetition without adding meaning.

- **Property Naming Alignment**:
  Boolean properties use `IsValid`, not `GetIsValid`.
  Using the same pattern for methods creates consistency.

- **Cleaner API Design**:
  Direct query methods create more elegant, expressive APIs.
  They feel more professional and easier to use.

- **Shorter Method Names**:
  Removing redundant prefixes makes names more concise without sacrificing clarity.
  This improves code scannability.

- **Better Code Comprehension**:
  When method names read like natural questions or statements, code is easier to understand.
  `IsValid()` is clearer than `GetIsValid()`

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to remove the `Get` or `Set` prefix, keeping only the `Is`, `Can`, or `Has` prefix.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1017
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1017
