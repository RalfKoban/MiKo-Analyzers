# MiKo_2078: Do not include XML tags in `<code>` documentation

## Cause

The `<code>` documentation contains XML tags.

## Rule description

`<code>` documentation should not include XML tags.
Code snippets usually serve as examples and typically contain source code.
If they contain plain XML, the XML will not be converted into documentation.
Consequently, the resulting online help or IntelliSense will not display them.

### Rationale behind

The `<code>` tag is designed to contain actual source code that demonstrates how to use a type or member.
When XML documentation tags are placed inside `<code>` blocks, documentation generation tools may not process them correctly.

XML content inside code blocks can be misinterpreted by parsers, leading to broken documentation output or missing information in generated help files.
If XML needs to be shown as an example, it should be properly escaped or placed in a different context.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Correct Documentation Output**:
  Avoiding XML tags in code blocks ensures that documentation tools generate the output correctly.

- **Better IntelliSense Display**:
  Code examples appear properly formatted in IntelliSense without confusing markup.

- **Clearer Examples**:
  Source code examples that do not mix XML documentation tags are easier to read and understand.

- **Proper Tool Processing**:
  Documentation generation tools like Sandcastle can correctly process and format code examples.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Developers reading the code examples do not have to mentally separate actual code from documentation markup.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove XML documentation tags from within `<code>` blocks.
If XML content needs to be shown, use proper escaping or consider using a different documentation approach.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2078
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2078
```
