# MiKo_3009: Use named methods instead of lambda expressions with commands

## Cause

A command uses an anonymous lambda expression instead of a named method.

## Rule description

Avoid using anonymous lambdas for methods invoked by commands.
They can be hard to read, understand, and maintain.
Instead, use named methods with meaningful names.
This practice enhances code readability and maintainability, making the code clear and straightforward for developers.

### Rationale behind

Anonymous lambda expressions in command definitions obscure the actual operation being performed.
They make it difficult to understand what happens when a command executes and create challenges for debugging and testing.

Using named methods instead of lambda expressions provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Named methods clearly communicate what action the command performs.
  Developers can understand the command's purpose without reading its implementation.

- **Better Debugging**:
  Named methods appear clearly in stack traces and debugging sessions.
  Anonymous lambdas show as generic lambda expressions, making debugging harder.

- **Enhanced Testability**:
  Named methods can be tested independently of the command infrastructure.
  This enables focused unit tests that verify the logic in isolation.

- **Easier Reusability**:
  Named methods can be reused across multiple commands or called directly when needed.
  Anonymous lambdas are tied to a single command definition.

- **Clearer Code Organization**:
  Named methods can be grouped logically within the class.
  This creates a better structure compared to inline lambda expressions scattered throughout.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, extract the lambda expression into a named method and reference that method in the command definition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3009
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3009
```
