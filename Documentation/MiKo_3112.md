# MiKo_3112: Use `Is.Empty` instead of `Has.Count.Zero` in assertions

## Cause

A test method uses `Has.Count.Zero` instead of `Is.Empty` in an assertion on a collection.

## Rule description

To improve clarity, use `Is.Empty` instead of `Has.Count.Zero` when asserting on collections for emptiness in tests.
This makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Using specialized constraints like `Is.Empty` makes test assertions more expressive and clearly communicates intent.
Checking collection emptiness is a common operation that deserves a dedicated, readable constraint.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  `Is.Empty` directly expresses the intent to check for an empty collection.
  It is more intuitive than `Has.Count.Zero`, which requires additional mental processing.

- **More Natural Language**:
  `Is.Empty` reads like natural language and is self-explanatory.
  Developers can immediately understand what the assertion is checking.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Using `Is.Empty` creates a consistent pattern across the test suite for checking empty collections.
  All emptiness checks use the same clear, concise syntax.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  `Is.Empty` is shorter and more concise than `Has.Count.Zero`.
  Less code means easier reading and less visual clutter.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  The constraint explicitly states that emptiness is being tested.
  Count-based checks do not emphasize the semantic meaning of zero items.

- **Framework Best Practices**:
  NUnit provides `Is.Empty` specifically for checking empty collections.
  Using it aligns with the framework's design and recommended patterns.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `Has.Count.Zero` with `Is.Empty` in assertions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3112
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3112
```
