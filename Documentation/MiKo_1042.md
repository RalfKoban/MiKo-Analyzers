# MiKo_1042: Use specific name for `CancellationToken` parameters

## Cause

A parameter of type `CancellationToken` is not named according to the standard convention.

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance and align with .NET Framework standards, `CancellationToken` parameters should be consistently named.
This helps keep the code clear and consistent.

The standard name for a `CancellationToken` parameter is `cancellationToken`.
This convention is used throughout the .NET Framework and should be followed in the code.

### Rationale behind

Using a consistent name for `CancellationToken` parameters makes the code more predictable and easier to understand.
When all code follows the same naming convention, developers can quickly recognize the purpose of parameters without having to read documentation or hover over them.

Using the standard `cancellationToken` name provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  A consistent parameter name makes the code easier to scan and understand.
  Developers immediately recognize `cancellationToken` as the standard parameter for cancellation support.

- **Consistency with .NET Standards**:
  The .NET Framework uses `cancellationToken` as the standard parameter name throughout its APIs.
  Following this convention makes the code feel familiar to anyone working with .NET.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to remember different parameter names for the same concept across different methods.
  A single standard name simplifies understanding and reduces mental effort.

- **Better Tooling Support**:
  Many code analysis and refactoring tools expect the standard `cancellationToken` naming.
  Using this convention ensures better integration with development tools.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly spot when cancellation tokens are being used correctly without having to decipher non-standard names.
  This makes code reviews faster and more effective.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The name `cancellationToken` clearly communicates the parameter's purpose without ambiguity.
  Alternative names might be less clear or require additional mental translation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the `CancellationToken` parameter to `cancellationToken`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1042
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1042
```
