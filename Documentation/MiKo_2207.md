# MiKo_2207: Keep `<summary>` documentation short

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation is too long and contains detailed information that should be in the `<remarks>` section.

## Rule description

The `<summary>` documentation should be brief and descriptive, providing an overview of the functionality.
For more detailed information, use the `<remarks>` section.
This keeps the summary concise and the documentation well-organized, making it easier for developers to understand.

### Rationale behind

The `<summary>` tag appears in IntelliSense tooltips and should provide a quick overview that can be read at a glance.
When summaries become too long, they clutter IntelliSense and make it harder to quickly understand what a member does.

Detailed explanations, implementation notes, and usage guidelines belong in the `<remarks>` section where developers can read them when they need more information.
Keeping summaries brief ensures IntelliSense remains useful for quick reference.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  Short summaries fit well in tooltips and can be read quickly while coding.

- **Improved Scanability**:
  Brief summaries allow developers to quickly scan through multiple members to find what they need.

- **Proper Organization**:
  Separating overview from details creates well-structured documentation that is easier to navigate.

- **Reduced Clutter**:
  Keeping summaries short prevents IntelliSense from displaying overwhelming amounts of text.

- **Clearer Purpose**:
  Summaries focus on what something is or does, while remarks provide deeper insights and details.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move detailed information from the `<summary>` section to a `<remarks>` section.
Keep the summary brief and focused on the essential purpose of the member.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2207
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2207
```
