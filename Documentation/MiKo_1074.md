# MiKo_1074: Suffix lock objects with `Lock`

## Cause

A field used as a lock object does not end with `Lock`.

## Rule description

If an object is used for synchronizing threads with lock statements, add the suffix `Lock` to its name.
This makes it clear that the object is used as a synchronization mechanism.

### Rationale behind

Using the `Lock` suffix for synchronization objects helps developers immediately recognize objects that are used for thread synchronization.
This is especially important in multithreaded code where understanding synchronization points is critical for correctness and debugging.

When lock objects have clear, consistent names, it becomes much easier to reason about the threading behavior of the code.
Developers can quickly identify all synchronization points and understand what resources are being protected.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Code Safety**:
  Clear identification of lock objects helps prevent common threading mistakes, such as locking on the wrong object or missing necessary locks.

- **Better Readability**:
  The `Lock` suffix immediately signals to developers that this object is used for synchronization, making the threading model easier to understand.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When debugging threading issues or deadlocks, having lock objects clearly named makes it much faster to trace synchronization behavior and identify problems.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The suffix explicitly documents that an object's purpose is synchronization, preventing confusion about why the object exists.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Developers are less likely to accidentally lock on non-lock objects or use lock objects for other purposes when they are clearly identified.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that proper synchronization is in place and that lock objects are used consistently.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `Lock` suffix to the lock object's name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1074
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1074
```
