# MiKo_6053: Place single-line arguments on single line

## Cause

Single-line arguments are unnecessarily split across multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when single-line arguments are kept on a single line instead of splitting them over multiple lines.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

When arguments are simple enough to fit on a single line, splitting them across multiple lines creates unnecessary vertical space and makes the code harder to read.
The separation disrupts the natural flow of understanding method calls and their parameters.

Keeping single-line arguments on a single line provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Arguments that fit on one line are easier to read and understand at a glance.
  Developers can see the complete argument without scanning multiple lines.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Keeping simple arguments compact minimizes the vertical space they occupy.
  This allows developers to see more code on the screen at once, making it easier to understand the overall logic.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Method calls with single-line arguments read naturally when kept compact.
  This follows common programming conventions and makes the code more intuitive.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Compact arguments make it easier to scan through method calls and understand what values are being passed.
  This is especially helpful when reviewing or debugging code.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  When an argument is simple enough to fit on one line, keeping it compact emphasizes that it is straightforward.
  This helps distinguish simple arguments from more complex multi-line expressions.

- **Easier Code Maintenance**:
  Compact arguments are easier to modify and update.
  Developers can make changes to simple arguments without disrupting the overall structure of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the single-line argument to a single line.
Ensure that the argument is compact and reads naturally within the method call.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6053
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6053
```
