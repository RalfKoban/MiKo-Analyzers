# MiKo_3064: Do not use contraction "n't" in log messages

## Cause

A log message contains the contraction "n't" (such as "don't", "can't", "won't", etc.).

## Rule description

Sometimes, contractions are missed, causing unintentional errors.
To prevent this, it is best to avoid them entirely.

### Rationale behind

Contractions in log messages can create inconsistency and potential confusion, especially in internationalized applications or when logs are processed by automated systems.
Using full words makes logs more formal and professional.

Avoiding contractions in log messages provides several important benefits:

- **Consistency**:
  Using full words creates uniform log messages across the entire application.
  Mixed use of contractions and full words appears inconsistent and unprofessional.

- **Clarity**:
  Full words are unambiguous and easier to understand, especially for non-native speakers.
  Contractions can sometimes be misinterpreted or parsed incorrectly.

- **Professional Tone**:
  Log messages without contractions appear more formal and professional.
  This is appropriate for production applications and enterprise software.

- **Easier Parsing**:
  Automated log analysis tools can more easily process text without contractions.
  Search patterns and filters are simpler when text follows consistent rules.

- **Internationalization**:
  Contractions can be difficult to translate or may not have equivalents in other languages.
  Full words make internationalization and localization more straightforward.

- **Better Searchability**:
  Searching for "not" finds all instances, while searching for "n't" may miss variations.
  Consistent word usage makes logs easier to search and analyze.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace contractions with full words.
Change "can't" to "cannot", "don't" to "do not", "isn't" to "is not", etc.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3064
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3064
```
