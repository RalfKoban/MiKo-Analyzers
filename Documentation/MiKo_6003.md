# MiKo_6003: Precede local variable statements with blank lines

## Cause

Local variables are not preceded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Precede local variables with blank lines to visually separate them from executing code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Preceding local variable declarations with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code organization and visual structure.
Variable declarations represent a different type of statement than executable code, and separating them visually helps developers distinguish between setup/initialization and the actual logic that follows.

Preceding local variable statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Organization**:
  Blank lines before variable declarations create distinct sections within the code.
  This makes it easy to see where variables are declared versus where they are used.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When variable declarations are visually separated, the code structure becomes clearer.
  Developers can quickly identify the initialization phase before the execution phase.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Separated variable declarations are easier to locate when scanning through code.
  The blank lines act as visual markers that draw attention to where new variables are introduced.

- **Enhanced Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the code flow.
  The blank line signals a transition from previous logic to new variable introduction.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  During code reviews, preceded variable declarations are easier to spot and verify.
  Reviewers can quickly check variable names, types, and initialization without searching through dense code.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When variable declarations are clearly separated, adding or modifying variables is simpler.
  The visual structure makes it obvious where variable declarations belong.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a blank line before local variable declarations.
Ensure each variable declaration or group of related declarations is preceded by a blank line to separate it from executing code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6003
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6003
```
