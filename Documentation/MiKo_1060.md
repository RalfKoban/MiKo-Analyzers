# MiKo_1060: Use `<Entity>NotFound` instead of `Get<Entity>Failed` or `<Entity>Missing`

## Cause

An exception name uses `Failed` or `Missing` instead of `NotFound`.

## Rule description

When developers need to indicate that an entity was not found, they might have a repository method like `GetXyz` that returns an error code (e.g., null) or throws an exception if `Xyz` does not exist.

Naming the exception `GetXyzFailedException` is unclear because it does not specify the reason for the failure.
A better name would be `XyzNotFoundException`, indicating that `Xyz` was not found.

Similarly, using `XyzMissingException` is also misleading.
`Missing` implies it should be there but is not, whereas `not found` simply states it does not exist.
Hence, `XyzNotFoundException` is a clearer and more precise choice.

### Rationale behind

Exception names should communicate clearly what went wrong.
When an exception name uses `Failed` or `Missing`, it creates ambiguity about the actual problem.
Using the `NotFound` suffix provides clarity and follows established conventions from the .NET framework itself.

Using `NotFound` in exception names provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Communication**:
  The name immediately tells developers that something was searched for but could not be located.
  There is no ambiguity about what went wrong.

- **Consistency with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET framework uses `NotFound` in many places like `FileNotFoundException` and `DirectoryNotFoundException`.
  Following this pattern makes the code feel familiar to other developers.

- **Precise Meaning**:
  `NotFound` is neutral and factual, simply stating that something does not exist.
  `Missing` suggests something should be there, and `Failed` does not explain why the operation failed.

- **Better Error Handling**:
  When exception types are specific and clear, developers can write better error handling code.
  They know exactly what situation they are dealing with.

- **Improved Debugging**:
  Clear exception names help developers quickly understand what went wrong when reading logs or debugging.
  Less time is spent figuring out what an exception actually means.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the exception to use `NotFound` instead of `Failed` or `Missing`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1060
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1060
```
