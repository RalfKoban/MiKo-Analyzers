# MiKo_1047: Do not falsely indicate asynchronous behavior for methods not following Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)

## Cause

A method ends with the suffix `Async` but does not follow the [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap).

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance, do not add the `Async` suffix to methods that do not follow the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP).
Using `Async` implies they do follow the pattern, which would be misleading.

The `Async` suffix should only be used for methods that return `Task`, `Task<T>`, `ValueTask`, or `ValueTask<T>`.
Using it for other methods creates confusion about the method's asynchronous nature.

### Rationale behind

The `Async` suffix is a strong signal to developers that a method follows the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern and must be awaited.
Using this suffix on methods that do not return awaitable types creates confusion and can lead to bugs.

Reserving the `Async` suffix only for true asynchronous methods provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Misleading Code**:
  When a method has the `Async` suffix, developers expect to await it or handle its `Task` return value.
  If the method does not return a `Task`, this expectation is violated and can cause confusion.

- **Maintains Trust in Naming Conventions**:
  If some methods with `Async` are truly asynchronous and others are not, developers lose trust in the naming convention.
  Consistent usage ensures the suffix remains a reliable indicator.

- **Reduces Debugging Time**:
  Developers investigating asynchronous behavior can trust that only methods with `Async` are truly asynchronous.
  This makes debugging concurrency issues much faster.

- **Consistency with .NET Standards**:
  The .NET Framework only uses `Async` for methods that follow TAP.
  Following this convention keeps the code aligned with framework standards.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  A method without the `Async` suffix clearly indicates it is synchronous.
  This helps developers understand the execution model without checking the return type.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly spot methods that incorrectly use the `Async` suffix.
  This helps maintain code quality and prevent misleading names.

- **Improved Tooling Accuracy**:
  Code analysis tools expect the `Async` suffix to indicate TAP methods.
  Misusing the suffix can cause tools to provide incorrect warnings or suggestions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Async` suffix from the method name if it does not return `Task`, `Task<T>`, `ValueTask`, or `ValueTask<T>`.
Choose a different name that accurately describes what the method does without implying asynchronous behavior.

For example, if a method named `ProcessAsync` returns `void`, rename it to `Process` or `ProcessInBackground`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1047
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1047
```
