# MiKo_1105: Name one-time test initialization methods `PrepareTestEnvironment`

## Cause

A one-time test setup method is not named `PrepareTestEnvironment`.

## Rule description

One-time test setup methods (marked with `[OneTimeSetUp]` or similar attributes) should be consistently named `PrepareTestEnvironment` to clearly indicate their purpose and improve readability.

### Rationale behind

Using a consistent name for one-time test setup methods is important for test code readability and maintainability.

Naming all one-time test setup methods `PrepareTestEnvironment` provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  Developers can instantly recognize one-time setup methods across all test classes without having to check attributes or read method bodies.
  This standardization reduces cognitive load when navigating test code.

- **Clear Scope Distinction**:
  The name `PrepareTestEnvironment` clearly indicates that this method runs once for the entire test fixture, not before each individual test.
  This distinction from `PrepareTest` helps prevent confusion about when the setup logic executes.

- **Consistent Team Standards**:
  A uniform naming convention ensures all team members follow the same pattern, making code reviews easier and reducing debates about naming choices.

- **Better Understanding of Test Lifecycle**:
  The name explicitly communicates that this method sets up the broader test environment, which helps developers understand the test execution flow and resource allocation.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all one-time setup methods have the same name, it is easier to find and modify initialization logic across multiple test classes.
  This consistency speeds up maintenance tasks.

- **Reduced Risk of Errors**:
  Clear naming helps prevent mistakes where developers might confuse per-test setup with one-time setup, which could lead to resource leaks or incorrect test isolation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the one-time test setup method to `PrepareTestEnvironment`.

#pragma warning disable MiKo_1105
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1105
