# MiKo_3082: Use pattern matching instead of comparing with `true` or `false`

## Cause

A condition uses the equality operator (`==`) to compare with `true` or `false` instead of pattern matching.

## Rule description

Using the `is` pattern matching for logical comparisons is more natural and easier to read than the `==` equality operator.
This approach enhances code clarity and comprehension, making the code cleaner and more intuitive.

### Rationale behind

Comparing boolean values using the `==` operator adds unnecessary verbosity to the code.
Modern C# provides pattern matching syntax that expresses the same logic more clearly and concisely.

Using pattern matching for boolean comparisons provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Code Clarity**:
  The pattern `value is true` reads more naturally than `value == true`.
  It clearly expresses a type check and value comparison in a more fluent way.

- **Reduces Redundancy**:
  When checking if a boolean is true, the comparison itself is redundant.
  Pattern matching makes this less verbose while maintaining clarity.

- **Maintains Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching for boolean checks creates consistency with other modern C# patterns like null checks and type checks.
  This leads to a more uniform coding style.

- **Simplifies Complex Conditions**:
  In complex boolean expressions, pattern matching can make the logic clearer by explicitly stating what is being checked without relying on operator precedence rules.

- **Handles Nullable Booleans Better**:
  Pattern matching makes it clearer how null values are handled in nullable boolean scenarios.
  The distinction between `is true`, `is false`, and `is null` is more explicit than using `==`.

- **Follows Modern C# Conventions**:
  Pattern matching is the recommended approach in modern C# guidelines.
  Using it consistently helps keep code aligned with current best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `value == true` with `value is true` and `value == false` with `value is false`.
For nullable booleans, consider whether `is true`, `is false`, `is not true`, or `is not false` best expresses the intended logic including null handling.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3082
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3082
```
