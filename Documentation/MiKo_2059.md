# MiKo_2059: Consolidate multiple documentations of same exception into one

## Cause

The same exception type is documented multiple times instead of being consolidated into a single entry.

## Rule description

To improve readability and maintenance, document thrown exceptions only once, consolidating them instead of listing multiple separate instances.
This approach helps developers find specific information more easily and keeps the documentation clean and efficient.

### Rationale behind

When multiple conditions can cause the same exception type to be thrown, it is clearer and more maintainable to document all conditions in a single exception entry rather than repeating the exception type multiple times.
Consolidated documentation is easier to read and update.

Consolidating exception documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  A single exception entry with multiple conditions is easier to read than multiple separate entries for the same exception type.
  Developers can see all the conditions at once without scanning through repeated exception types.

- **Better Documentation Organization**:
  Consolidating exceptions creates a cleaner, more organized documentation structure.
  This makes the documentation feel more professional and well-maintained.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When conditions are consolidated, updating exception documentation is simpler.
  Changes to the exception type or general exception behavior only need to be made in one place.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Eliminating repeated exception type declarations removes redundancy from the documentation.
  This makes the documentation more concise and efficient.

- **Clearer Condition Relationships**:
  When multiple conditions are listed together, developers can better understand the relationship between different error cases.
  This improves understanding of the method's validation logic.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  Documentation tools and IntelliSense can present consolidated exception information more effectively.
  This improves the overall developer experience when consuming the API.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, consolidate multiple documentation entries for the same exception type into a single `<exception>` tag.
List all the conditions that can cause the exception within that single entry, using proper formatting such as lists or line breaks to separate different conditions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2059
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2059
```
