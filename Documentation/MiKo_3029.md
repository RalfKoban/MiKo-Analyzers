# MiKo_3029: Prevent memory leaks in event registrations

## Cause

Code registers for an event without a corresponding unregistration that could prevent memory leaks.

## Rule description

Forgetting to unregister from an event can lead to memory leaks, especially when the event is static or belongs to an object with a long lifetime.
Always ensure event handlers are unregistered to prevent these issues.
Proper event handling maintains memory efficiency and keeps applications running smoothly.

### Rationale behind

Event subscriptions create strong references from the event source to the subscriber.
When subscribers are no longer needed but remain subscribed, they cannot be garbage collected, causing memory leaks.

Properly unregistering from events provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Memory Leaks**:
  Unregistered event handlers allow objects to be garbage collected when they are no longer needed.
  Without unregistration, objects remain in memory indefinitely.

- **Improved Application Performance**:
  Memory leaks degrade application performance over time.
  Proper event cleanup ensures the application maintains consistent performance.

- **Reduced Resource Consumption**:
  Leaked objects consume memory that could be used elsewhere.
  Unregistering events frees resources for productive use.

- **Avoids Unexpected Behavior**:
  Event handlers on disposed objects can cause unexpected errors.
  Unregistering prevents handlers from executing after objects are no longer valid.

- **Better Application Stability**:
  Memory leaks can eventually cause applications to crash.
  Proper event management ensures long-running applications remain stable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that event handlers are unregistered when the subscribing object is no longer needed, typically in a Dispose method or appropriate cleanup location.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3029
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3029
```
