# MiKo_3006: Place `CancellationToken` parameter last in method parameters

## Cause

A `CancellationToken` parameter is not the last parameter in the method signature.

## Rule description

To ensure consistency with .NET Framework classes and ease maintenance, place `CancellationToken` parameters after all other method parameters.
This practice keeps the codebase predictable and aligned with established conventions, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Inconsistent parameter ordering makes APIs confusing and harder to use.
The .NET Framework consistently places `CancellationToken` parameters last, and deviating from this pattern breaks developer expectations.

Placing `CancellationToken` parameters last provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  This pattern is used throughout the .NET Framework and most popular libraries.
  Following it makes the API familiar and intuitive for all .NET developers.

- **Better API Evolution**:
  When `CancellationToken` is last, new parameters can be added before it without breaking changes.
  This provides flexibility for future API enhancements.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  Developers know where to expect the `CancellationToken` parameter.
  This reduces cognitive load when reading method signatures.

- **Easier Method Overloading**:
  Standard parameter ordering makes it simpler to provide overloads with and without `CancellationToken`.
  The pattern is clear and predictable.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Consistent parameter positioning helps prevent mistakes when calling methods.
  Developers are less likely to pass arguments in the wrong order.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the `CancellationToken` parameter to the last position in the method signature.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3006
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3006
```
