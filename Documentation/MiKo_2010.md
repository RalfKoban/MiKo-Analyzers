# MiKo_2010: Document sealed classes as being sealed

## Cause

A sealed class documentation does not mention that the class is sealed.

## Rule description

To simplify their use in inheritance scenarios, sealed classes should clearly document that they are sealed.
This helps developers understand their constraints and usage better.

### Rationale behind

Sealed classes cannot be inherited, which is an important constraint that affects how developers can use them.
When this restriction is not documented, developers may waste time attempting to inherit from a class only to encounter compiler errors.

Documenting the sealed status provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Usage Constraints**:
  Developers immediately know that inheritance is not possible without needing to examine the class declaration.
  This saves time and prevents frustration during development.

- **Design Intent Communication**:
  Marking a class as sealed is a deliberate design decision.
  Documenting this status communicates that the class is complete and not intended for extension, which helps developers understand the architecture.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework documents sealed classes with phrases like `This class cannot be inherited.`
  Following the same pattern creates consistency with framework documentation.

- **Prevents Misunderstanding**:
  Without explicit documentation, developers might not realize a class is sealed until they try to inherit from it.
  Clear documentation prevents this confusion and guides developers toward correct usage patterns.

- **Better API Understanding**:
  When browsing API documentation or IntelliSense, developers get complete information about the class capabilities and limitations.
  This leads to more informed design decisions.

- **Reduced Support Questions**:
  Clear documentation about sealed status reduces questions about why inheritance is not working.
  Developers can see the constraint immediately in the documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a note to the class documentation indicating that it is sealed.

Include a statement such as `This class cannot be inherited.` in the class summary or remarks section.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2010
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2010
```
