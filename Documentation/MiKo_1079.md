# MiKo_1079: Do not suffix repositories with `Repository`

## Cause

A repository class name ends with `Repository`.

## Rule description

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) defines repository classes.
However, those classes should not be suffixed with `Repository` as everybody understands different things as a repository.

### Rationale behind

The term "repository" has different meanings across different contexts, teams, and frameworks.
Some developers think of repositories as data access layers, others as domain object collections, and others as version control systems.

Using the `Repository` suffix creates ambiguity because it does not clearly communicate what the class actually does.
Different developers and teams interpret the term differently, leading to confusion about the class's purpose and responsibilities.

Domain-Driven Design advocates for using more specific, domain-focused names that describe what the class contains or manages rather than its technical classification.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Domain Language**:
  Names like `Users` or `UserStore` directly describe what the class manages, making the domain model more understandable.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Avoiding the overloaded term `Repository` prevents confusion about what pattern or approach the class follows.

- **Better Domain Modeling**:
  Domain-focused names help maintain the ubiquitous language of the domain, making code more aligned with business concepts.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  Specific names like `ProductCatalog` or `OrderHistory` are more descriptive than generic terms like `ProductRepository` or `OrderRepository`.

- **Flexibility in Design**:
  When not locked into the `Repository` term, developers are free to choose more appropriate patterns and names that better fit their specific needs.

- **Easier Communication**:
  Using domain-specific names makes it easier to communicate about the code with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Repository` suffix from the class name.
