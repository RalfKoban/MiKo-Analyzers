# MiKo_5019: Add `[in]` modifier to read-only struct parameters

## Cause

A method parameter is a read-only struct but is not marked with the `[in]` modifier.

## Rule description

Using the `[in]` modifier for read-only struct parameters helps improve performance.
It prevents the struct from being copied by value, which reduces the workload on the garbage collector.

### Rationale behind

In .NET, structs are value types that are normally passed by value.
This means that when a struct is passed to a method, the entire struct is copied.
For small structs with a few fields, this is efficient.
However, larger structs or structs passed frequently can create significant overhead from all the copying.

The `[in]` modifier tells the compiler to pass the struct by reference instead of by value.
This means the method receives a reference to the original struct rather than a copy.
For read-only structs that the method does not modify, this eliminates unnecessary copying without changing behavior.

Using the `[in]` modifier for read-only struct parameters provides important benefits:

- **No Struct Copying**:
  Passing by reference avoids copying all the struct's fields onto the stack.
  For structs with many fields or large fields, this saves significant time and stack space.

- **Better Performance**:
  Eliminating copies means less work for the CPU.
  Methods that are called frequently can see measurable performance improvements.

- **Reduced Stack Usage**:
  Each copy of a struct uses stack space.
  Passing by reference uses only a pointer-sized slot on the stack, regardless of struct size.

- **Compiler Guarantees**:
  The `[in]` modifier guarantees the method cannot modify the parameter.
  This provides safety similar to passing by value but with the performance of passing by reference.

- **Consistent with Modern Patterns**:
  Using `[in]` for read-only struct parameters follows .NET performance best practices.
  It helps optimize code without changing behavior.

- **Scalability**:
  Code that works fine with small structs can slow down as structs grow.
  Using `[in]` ensures the code remains efficient even if struct definitions change.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `[in]` modifier to read-only struct parameters.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5019
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5019
