# MiKo_2073: Start `Contains` method `<summary>` documentation with `Determines whether`

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation of a `Contains` method does not start with `Determines whether`.

## Rule description

The `<summary>` documentation of `Contains` methods should start with the phrase `Determines whether...`.
This is because they attempt to determine if something exists within something else.
This phrase sets a clear expectation for the method's functionality.

### Rationale behind

`Contains` methods are query methods that check for the presence of an element or value within a collection or structure.
Documentation that does not use the standard `Determines whether` phrase can be unclear about the method's purpose and return type.

Using a consistent phrase across all `Contains` methods helps developers quickly recognize the method's pattern and understand what it does.
This consistency is important because `Contains` is a common operation throughout .NET libraries.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  The standard phrase helps developers instantly understand that the method checks for existence and returns a boolean.

- **Consistent API Documentation**:
  Using the same pattern as .NET Framework and .NET libraries makes the codebase feel familiar and professional.

- **Clear Return Type Indication**:
  `Determines whether` naturally leads to a question that has a yes or no answer, indicating a boolean return type.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  Developers looking for existence-checking methods can easily identify them by the consistent documentation pattern.

- **Reduced Learning Curve**:
  When all `Contains` methods follow the same documentation pattern, developers spend less time understanding each one.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the `<summary>` documentation to start with `Determines whether`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2073
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2073
