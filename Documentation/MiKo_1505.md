# MiKo_1505: Do not suffix fields with `Counter`

## Cause

A field name ends with `Counter`.

## Rule description

Fields that hold values but are suffixed with `Counter` are most likely not holding counters but counted values instead.
So they should be named accordingly.

Using precise naming helps developers understand what the field represents and improves code clarity.

### Rationale behind

Fields store data, and their names should accurately describe the type and nature of that data.
The suffix `Counter` suggests an object that performs counting actions, which is misleading when the field simply stores a numeric value.

Using appropriate naming provides several important benefits:

- **Accurate Type Communication**:
  A field named `itemsCounter` suggests it might be an instance of a Counter class, not an integer.
  Renaming to `itemsCounted` or `itemCount` clearly indicates it holds a numeric value.

- **Reduced Mental Translation**:
  Developers should not have to mentally translate `Counter` to `counted value` when reading code.
  Using the correct term reduces cognitive load and speeds up code comprehension.

- **Consistency Across Codebase**:
  When fields use accurate suffixes, the entire codebase becomes more consistent and predictable.
  This makes it easier for team members to navigate and understand different parts of the code.

- **Better Refactoring Safety**:
  Clear field names make refactoring safer because developers immediately understand what data is being moved or modified.
  Ambiguous names increase the risk of mistakes during code changes.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly understand the purpose and type of each field without having to look up declarations or implementations.
  This speeds up the review process and improves code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field to replace `Counter` with `counted` or another appropriate term.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1505
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1505
