# MiKo_5010: Do not use `object.Equals()` on value types

## Cause

The `object.Equals()` method is called on value types (structs, primitives, or enums).

## Rule description

Using `object.Equals()` on value types causes unnecessary boxing and unboxing, which pressures the garbage collector.
Instead, use the equality operator for comparing value types.
This improves performance by avoiding temporary object creation and garbage collection.

### Rationale behind

Value types in .NET are stored on the stack or inline in objects.
When passed to methods that expect `object` parameters, they must be boxed into heap-allocated objects.
The `object.Equals()` method takes `object` parameters, forcing value types to be boxed.
After the comparison, these boxed objects become garbage that the garbage collector must clean up.

Using the equality operator instead of `object.Equals()` provides important benefits:

- **No Boxing Overhead**:
  The equality operator works directly with value types without boxing them.
  This avoids allocating memory on the heap for temporary objects.

- **Reduced Garbage Collection Pressure**:
  Every boxing operation creates garbage.
  In loops or frequently called code, this can create significant work for the garbage collector.
  Using the equality operator eliminates this garbage.

- **Better Performance**:
  Boxing and unboxing operations take time.
  Direct comparison using the equality operator is much faster because it avoids these conversions.

- **Type Safety**:
  The equality operator is type-safe and catches comparison errors at compile time.
  `object.Equals()` accepts any object type, which can lead to runtime errors when comparing incompatible types.

- **Clearer Code**:
  The equality operator (`==`) is more readable and clearly expresses the intent to compare values.
  Method calls are more verbose and less idiomatic for simple comparisons.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `object.Equals()` calls with the equality operator.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5010
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5010
