# MiKo_3033: Use `nameof` for property names in PropertyChangingEventArgs and PropertyChangedEventArgs

## Cause

A `PropertyChangingEventArgs` or `PropertyChangedEventArgs` constructor uses a string literal instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

Use the `nameof` operator for property names passed into `PropertyChangingEventArgs` and `PropertyChangedEventArgs` constructors, instead of strings.
This avoids typos and invalid names and makes refactoring easier, as `nameof` ensures property names are automatically updated during renames, unlike strings.

### Rationale behind

Property change notifications are a critical part of data binding in frameworks like WPF and XAML.
When string literals are used for property names, there is no compile-time verification, which can lead to bugs that only manifest at runtime when bindings fail silently.

Using `nameof` provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Safety**:
  The compiler verifies that referenced properties actually exist.
  Typos or invalid property names are caught during compilation, preventing runtime binding failures.

- **Automatic Refactoring Support**:
  When properties are renamed using IDE refactoring tools, all `nameof` references are automatically updated.
  String literals remain unchanged, breaking bindings and causing silent failures in the UI.

- **IntelliSense Support**:
  The `nameof` operator works with IntelliSense, providing autocomplete and reducing the chance of errors.
  String literals offer no such assistance, requiring developers to remember exact property names.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Developers can use "Go to Definition" and "Find All References" on `nameof` expressions.
  String literals do not support these navigation features, making code harder to explore.

- **Reduced Debugging Time**:
  Binding errors caused by misspelled property names are eliminated.
  This saves significant time that would otherwise be spent debugging silent binding failures.

- **Better Code Quality**:
  Code using `nameof` is more maintainable and less error-prone.
  This leads to higher quality applications with fewer defects.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace string literals with the `nameof` operator.
Change `new PropertyChangedEventArgs("PropertyName")` to `new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(PropertyName))`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3033
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3033
```
