# MiKo_2305: Do not use double periods in comments

## Cause

An inline comment contains double periods ("..") at the end.

## Rule description

Inline comments are meant for team members, unlike API documentation.
They should be concise and contain important information, avoiding double dots at the end.
This keeps the communication clear and efficient for quick understanding within the team.

### Rationale behind

Double periods at the end of comments suggest trailing off or incomplete thoughts.
They create an uncertain, unprofessional tone and may indicate that the comment was not carefully written or reviewed.

Avoiding double periods in comments provides several important benefits:

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Double periods look like typos or careless writing.
  Proper punctuation makes comments appear more professional and carefully considered.

- **Clear Communication**:
  Double periods can suggest uncertainty or trailing thoughts.
  Clear, decisive punctuation communicates confidence and clarity.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  Readers may wonder if double periods were intentional or accidental.
  This creates unnecessary mental overhead when reading comments.

- **Consistent Style**:
  Enforcing proper punctuation creates consistency across the codebase.
  Developers know what to expect and the code appears better maintained.

- **Better Focus**:
  Comments should convey information clearly and completely.
  Double periods suggest the thought was not fully developed or expressed.

- **Attention to Detail**:
  Avoiding punctuation errors demonstrates attention to detail in both comments and code.
  This builds confidence in overall code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace double periods with a single period or remove them entirely depending on the commenting style being used.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2305
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2305
