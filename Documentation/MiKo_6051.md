# MiKo_6051: Place colon of constructor call on same line as constructor call

## Cause

The colon leading a constructor call is placed on a different line than the constructor call itself.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when colons leading constructor calls are placed on the same lines as the calls themselves.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Constructor chaining is a common pattern in C# where one constructor calls another constructor in the same class or the base class.
When the colon is separated from the constructor call, it disrupts the natural flow of reading the code and makes the relationship less clear.

Placing the colon on the same line as the constructor call provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete constructor delegation is visible on one line, making it immediately clear which constructor is being called.
  Developers can understand the constructor chain without scanning multiple lines.

- **Clearer Constructor Relationships**:
  Keeping the colon with the constructor call makes it obvious that constructor chaining is occurring.
  This helps developers understand the initialization flow of the class.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Constructor delegation reads naturally when the colon and the constructor call are together.
  This follows the C# syntax pattern and makes the code more intuitive to read.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When the constructor delegation fits on one line, it can be processed as a single unit of information.
  Developers do not need to mentally combine pieces from multiple lines.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  Compact constructor delegation makes it easier to scan through constructors and understand which ones call others.
  This is helpful when understanding class initialization patterns.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify constructor chaining during code reviews when it is compact and self-contained.
  It is easier to check that the correct base or sibling constructor is being called.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the colon and the constructor call to the same line as the constructor declaration.
Ensure that the constructor delegation is compact and reads naturally.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6051
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6051
```
