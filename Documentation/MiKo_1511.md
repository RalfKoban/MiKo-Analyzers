# MiKo_1511: Do not prefix or suffix local variables with `proxy`

## Cause

A local variable name contains `proxy` as a prefix or suffix.

## Rule description

The purpose of the Proxy Pattern is to control access to another object (e.g., for lazy loading, access control, logging), without directly exposing the real object.
However, from the developer's perspective, the proxy is used *as if* it were the real object.
Therefore, names should reflect the intended role rather than the implementation detail, avoiding prefixes or suffixes like `Proxy`.

Using implementation-agnostic names improves code clarity and maintains proper abstraction.

### Rationale behind

The Proxy Pattern exists to provide transparent access control and additional behavior without changing how clients interact with an object.
Naming variables with `proxy` defeats this purpose by exposing the implementation detail to the code that uses it.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Proper Abstraction**:
  The whole point of a proxy is that clients should not know or care that they are working with a proxy.
  Naming a variable `userProxy` breaks this abstraction and makes the code dependent on implementation details.

- **Code That Reads Naturally**:
  Code like `userProxy.GetName()` is less readable than `user.GetName()`.
  The proxy suffix adds noise and makes developers think about technical details rather than business logic.

- **Better Substitutability**:
  If you later remove the proxy and use the real object directly, you would have to rename all variables.
  Using `user` from the start means no changes are needed when implementation details change.

- **Reduced Coupling**:
  When variable names reference implementation patterns, the code becomes mentally coupled to those patterns.
  This makes it harder to refactor or change approaches later.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Variable names should describe what role the object plays in the business logic.
  Whether it is a proxy or not is an implementation detail that belongs in the type system, not in variable names.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the local variable to remove `proxy` from its name and use a name that reflects its intended role.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1511
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1511
```
