# MiKo_2074: End `Contains` method parameter documentation with default phrase

## Cause

The parameter documentation of a `Contains` method does not end with the phrase ` to seek.`.

## Rule description

The parameter documentation of `Contains` methods should end with the phrase ` to seek.`.
This is because they attempt to determine if a given parameter's value exists within something.
This phrasing clearly communicates the intent and functionality of the parameter within the method.

### Rationale behind

`Contains` methods search for a specific element within a collection or structure.
The parameter represents what is being looked for, and the documentation should make this clear.

Using ` to seek.` as a standard ending creates consistency across all `Contains` methods and clearly indicates the parameter's role.
This helps developers understand that the parameter is the target of the search operation.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Parameter Role**:
  The phrase ` to seek.` immediately communicates that this parameter is what the method searches for.

- **Consistent Parameter Documentation**:
  Using the same pattern across all `Contains` methods makes the API more predictable and easier to learn.

- **Better Understanding**:
  Developers can quickly grasp the relationship between the parameter and the method's purpose.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Consistent phrasing makes the documentation appear well-thought-out and polished.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  The standard phrase eliminates confusion about what the parameter represents in the search operation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the parameter documentation to end with ` to seek.`.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_2074
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2074
