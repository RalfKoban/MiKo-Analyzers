# MiKo_1068: Name workflow methods `CanRun` or `Run`

## Cause

A workflow method is not named `CanRun` or `Run`.

## Rule description

Workflows, being high-level constructs within the business layer, should have methods named `CanRun` or `Run`, much like commands that use `CanExecute` and `Execute`.

This naming convention keeps things consistent and clear.

### Rationale behind

Workflows represent business processes or operations that need to be executed as a unit.
Following a consistent naming pattern for workflow methods makes the codebase more predictable and easier to understand.
The `CanRun`/`Run` pattern mirrors the well-established `CanExecute`/`Execute` pattern used in command objects.

Using `CanRun` and `Run` for workflow methods provides several important benefits:

- **Consistency with Command Pattern**:
  The `CanRun`/`Run` naming mirrors the `CanExecute`/`Execute` pattern from the Command pattern.
  Developers familiar with commands will immediately understand this pattern.

- **Clear Intent**:
  The names make it obvious that workflows are meant to be executed.
  `Run` clearly indicates starting a process, and `CanRun` checks if the process can start.

- **Predictable API**:
  When all workflows use the same method names, developers know exactly what to expect.
  There is no need to remember different method names for different workflows.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Standardized names help identify workflow classes in the codebase.
  It becomes easier to find and organize business process logic.

- **Simplified Testing**:
  When all workflows follow the same pattern, test code can be more generic and reusable.
  Testing frameworks can use consistent patterns across different workflows.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When method names are predictable, finding and updating workflow logic becomes straightforward.
  Developers do not need to search for various execution method names.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename workflow methods to `CanRun` or `Run`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1068
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1068
