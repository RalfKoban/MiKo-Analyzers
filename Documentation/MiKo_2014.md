# MiKo_2014: Document Dispose methods as done by the .NET Framework

## Cause

A Dispose method documentation does not follow the .NET Framework's documentation style.

## Rule description

Dispose methods should follow the .NET Framework's documentation style.
This ensures consistency and clarity, making it easier for developers to understand and implement disposal patterns correctly.

### Rationale behind

The Dispose pattern is a fundamental part of resource management in .NET.
The .NET Framework uses specific documentation conventions for Dispose methods that developers have come to expect and understand.

Following framework documentation conventions provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework documents Dispose methods with standard phrases about releasing resources.
  Using the same language makes custom implementations feel like native framework classes.

- **Clear Resource Management**:
  Standard documentation clearly communicates that the method releases unmanaged resources and performs cleanup.
  This helps developers understand when and why to call Dispose.

- **Established Patterns**:
  Developers familiar with IDisposable know how to interpret framework-style Dispose documentation.
  Following the same pattern leverages this existing knowledge.

- **Better Usage Understanding**:
  Consistent documentation helps developers understand the importance of calling Dispose in using statements or finally blocks.
  This promotes proper resource management throughout the application.

- **Simplified Maintenance**:
  When all Dispose methods follow the same documentation pattern, code reviews become easier.
  Reviewers can quickly verify that disposal is documented and implemented correctly.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Following established framework conventions demonstrates adherence to .NET best practices.
  This makes the codebase appear more professional and well-designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the Dispose method documentation to follow the .NET Framework style.

Include standard phrases about releasing resources and performing cleanup operations.
Follow the pattern used in framework classes that implement IDisposable.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2014
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2014
```
