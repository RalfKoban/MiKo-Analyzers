# MiKo_2041: Do not include other documentation tags in `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation contains tags that should be placed outside the summary section.

## Rule description

The `<summary>` documentation should be concise and only contain a brief summary description.
Other information should be included in the appropriate XML tags alongside the `<summary>`.
This ensures clarity and organization in the documentation.

### Rationale behind

The `<summary>` tag has a specific purpose: to provide a brief overview of what a type or member does.
Other documentation elements such as parameters, return values, exceptions, and remarks have their own dedicated tags and should not be mixed into the summary.

Keeping the `<summary>` focused and concise provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Documentation Structure**:
  Separating different types of information into appropriate tags creates a well-organized documentation structure.
  Developers can quickly find the specific information they need without reading through mixed content.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  Documentation tools and IntelliSense are designed to display different documentation sections appropriately.
  When information is in the [correct tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments), tools can present it in the most useful way.

- **Improved Readability**:
  A brief summary is easier to read and understand than a long paragraph containing multiple types of information.
  Developers can quickly grasp what a type or member does from the summary alone.

- **Consistent Documentation Pattern**:
  Following the XML documentation conventions creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes documentation more predictable and professional.

- **Better Maintenance**:
  When documentation elements are properly separated, updating specific information is easier.
  Changes to parameters or exceptions do not require modifying the summary.

- **Proper Information Hierarchy**:
  Structured documentation creates a clear hierarchy of information, with the summary providing the high-level overview and other tags providing detailed information.
  This helps developers understand the big picture before diving into details.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move information that does not belong in the `<summary>` to the appropriate documentation tags.
Keep the `<summary>` brief and focused on describing what the type or member does.
Use `<remarks>` for additional details, `<param>` for parameter descriptions, `<returns>` for return value documentation, and [other appropriate tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments) for their specific purposes.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2041
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2041
```
