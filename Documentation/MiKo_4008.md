# MiKo_4008: Place GetHashCode methods directly after Equals methods

## Cause

GetHashCode methods are not placed directly after Equals methods.

## Rule description

`GetHashCode` and `Equals` are used together to manage instances in dictionaries or hashsets.
`GetHashCode` computes a hash, and if a collision occurs, `Equals` identifies the instance.
Because they are closely related, they should be located near each other in the code.

### Rationale behind

The `GetHashCode` and `Equals` methods form a critical pair that must be implemented consistently to ensure correct behavior in hash-based collections.

When these methods are separated in the code, it becomes harder to maintain their relationship and verify that they use the same fields for comparison, which is essential for correctness.

Placing `GetHashCode` methods directly after `Equals` methods provides several important benefits:

- **Ensured Consistency**:
  When both methods are side-by-side, it is much easier to verify that they use the same fields and follow the same logic.
  This helps prevent subtle bugs where objects that are equal have different hash codes.

- **Better Understanding of Contracts**:
  The proximity of these methods makes their relationship obvious.
  Developers immediately understand that these methods work together to define object equality and hashing.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When updating the fields used for equality comparison, having both methods together ensures that developers update both consistently.
  This reduces the risk of breaking the equality contract.

- **Improved Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly check that the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` implementations are compatible.
  They do not need to scroll through the file to compare the implementations.

- **Reduced Risk of Bugs**:
  Hash-based collection bugs caused by inconsistent `Equals` and `GetHashCode` implementations are notoriously difficult to debug.
  Keeping these methods together helps prevent such issues from occurring.

- **Clear Documentation**:
  The side-by-side placement serves as visual documentation of the important relationship between these methods.
  Even developers unfamiliar with the codebase can see that these methods are related.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the `GetHashCode` method so it appears directly after the `Equals` method.

Keep these two methods adjacent without any other members in between.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4008
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4008
```
