# MiKo_0007: Limit local function parameters

## Cause

A local function has too many parameters.

## Rule description

To follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), local functions should use as few parameters as possible.
When a local function has too many parameters, it often indicates that the local function is doing too much or that it might be better implemented as a regular method.

Local functions with many parameters are harder to understand, use, and maintain, making the codebase more difficult to work with.

### Rationale behind

Local functions with many parameters are difficult to understand and use.
Having too many parameters makes local function calls harder to read and increases complexity.
Since local functions can access variables from their containing method, they should take advantage of this closure capability instead of requiring many parameters.

Keeping parameter lists short in local functions provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Local functions with few parameters are easier to read and understand.
  When a local function needs many parameters, it becomes harder to see what data it actually needs.
  Using variables from the containing scope makes the code more concise and clearer.

- **Better Use of Closures**:
  Local functions can access variables from their containing method without passing them as parameters.
  This is one of the key advantages of local functions over regular methods.
  When a local function has many parameters, it is not taking advantage of this closure capability.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When a local function has fewer parameters, it is easier to modify.
  Changes to parameters require updating all call sites within the containing method.
  Accessing variables from the containing scope eliminates this burden.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  A long parameter list in a local function suggests that the logic might be better placed elsewhere.
  It may indicate that the logic is complex enough to warrant a regular private method.
  Short parameter lists keep local functions focused on their specific purpose.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Many parameters increase the cognitive load when reading and understanding the code.
  Each parameter is another piece of information to track and understand.
  Using closure variables reduces this mental burden.

- **Better Design Signals**:
  When a local function needs many parameters, it often signals a design issue.
  The logic might be too complex for a local function or belong in a separate method.
  This encourages developers to reconsider code organization and make better design decisions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reduce the number of parameters.
You can do this by:

- Using variables from the containing method's scope instead of passing them as parameters
- Creating a parameter object that groups related parameters together
- Breaking the local function into smaller local functions with fewer parameters
- Converting the local function to a regular method if it needs many parameters
- Reconsidering whether all parameters are truly necessary

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_0007
#pragma warning restore MiKo_0007
```
