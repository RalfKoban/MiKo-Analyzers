# MiKo_2001: Document events properly

## Cause

An event documentation does not start with the phrase `Occurs`.

## Rule description

Events should be documented using the phrase `Occurs...` to clearly indicate that they occur.
This makes the documentation more precise.

### Rationale behind

Event documentation needs to clearly communicate when and under what conditions an event is raised.
Using a consistent pattern like `Occurs` makes it immediately obvious to developers that they are reading about an event rather than a method or property.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  Starting event documentation with `Occurs` allows developers to instantly identify events when browsing through IntelliSense or API documentation.
  This saves time when searching for specific functionality.

- **Consistent Documentation Style**:
  The .NET Framework uses this convention throughout its event documentation.
  Following the same pattern creates consistency across the codebase and with the framework itself.

- **Clear Intent**:
  The word `Occurs` precisely describes what events do.
  It clearly communicates that something happens at a specific point in time or under certain conditions.

- **Better Understanding**:
  Developers immediately understand the nature of the member without needing to examine its signature or implementation.
  This makes the code more accessible, especially for those less familiar with the codebase.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Following established documentation patterns demonstrates attention to quality and makes the codebase appear more polished and professional.
  This is particularly important for libraries or APIs that will be used by other developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the event documentation to start with `Occurs`.

Follow the pattern: `Occurs when [description of when the event is raised].`

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2001
```
