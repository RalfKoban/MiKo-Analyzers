# MiKo_6020: Surround throw statements with blank lines

## Cause

`throw` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `throw` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `throw` statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear exception handling visibility.
Throw statements represent exceptional conditions that interrupt normal program flow, and visually separating them helps developers understand where exceptions are raised and how error handling affects the code flow.

Surrounding throw statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Exception Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `throw` statements stand out as exception points.
  Developers can immediately identify where exceptions are raised in the code.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When throw statements are visually separated, the code logic is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that an exceptional condition has been detected and execution will be interrupted.

- **Better Error Handling Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the relationship between validation logic and exception throwing.
  This makes it clear what conditions trigger exceptions.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Visually distinct throw statements are easier to identify during code review.
  Reviewers can quickly locate where exceptions are raised and verify they are appropriate.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated throw statements are easier to locate when debugging exceptions.
  Developers can quickly find where exceptions originate to diagnose error conditions.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When throw statements are clearly separated, modifying exception handling is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where exceptions are raised.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `throw` statements.
Ensure each throw statement is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6020
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6020
```
