# MiKo_3012: Provide actual value when throwing ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions

## Cause

An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown without providing the actual value that caused the exception.

## Rule description

Thrown ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions (or its subtypes) should always include the actual value of the parameter that caused the exception.
This practice helps other developers quickly identify the problematic argument, facilitating easier debugging and improving overall code maintainability.

### Rationale behind

ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions without the actual value provide incomplete diagnostic information.
When an exception occurs, developers need to know not just which parameter failed, but also what value caused the failure.

Including actual values in ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions provides several important benefits:

- **Faster Root Cause Analysis**:
  When developers see the actual value that caused the exception, they can immediately understand why validation failed.
  This eliminates guesswork and speeds up problem resolution.

- **Better Log Analysis**:
  Exception logs that include actual values provide complete diagnostic information.
  Support teams can identify patterns and problematic inputs without reproducing the issue.

- **Improved Testing**:
  Test failures that show the actual value help developers understand what test data caused problems.
  This makes it easier to write additional test cases to cover edge cases.

- **Easier Troubleshooting**:
  When users report errors, the actual value in the exception helps support teams understand the context.
  This often reveals data quality issues or unexpected usage patterns.

- **More Informative Error Messages**:
  Complete exception information helps everyone involved in the development and support process.
  The error message becomes a valuable diagnostic tool rather than just a notification.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` constructor includes the actual parameter value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3012
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3012
```
