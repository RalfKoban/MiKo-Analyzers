# MiKo_1517: Express binary conditions clearly in boolean field names

## Cause

A boolean field name uses an abstract noun instead of an adjective or predicate.

## Rule description

Prefer naming boolean fields using adjectives or predicates to express a binary condition rather than abstract nouns.
This improves code clarity, avoids ambiguity, and helps developers immediately understand the true/false nature of the value.

Using clear, descriptive names for boolean fields makes code more readable and maintainable.

## Rationale

Boolean fields store binary state information about an object.
Their names should clearly express what condition they represent, making the class state easy to understand at a glance.

Using adjectives or predicates provides several important benefits:

- **Clear State Understanding**:
  Fields like `_isInitialized`, `_hasErrors`, or `_canRetry` immediately communicate what state they track.
  Abstract nouns like `_initialization`, `_errors`, or `_retry` leave developers guessing about the boolean interpretation.

- **Better Code Flow Reading**:
  Conditional logic like `if (_isConnected)` reads naturally.
  `if (_connection)` is ambiguous - does it check for a connection object or connection state?

- **Consistent Class Design**:
  When all boolean fields use predicates, the class structure becomes more consistent and predictable.
  This makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

- **Reduced Debugging Confusion**:
  When debugging, developers need to quickly understand what each field represents.
  Predicate names make boolean fields instantly recognizable and interpretable in the debugger.

- **Better Encapsulation**:
  When fields use clear predicate names, they better communicate the object's state to anyone reading the class implementation.
  This improves the overall quality of the internal API.

- **Easier State Management**:
  Boolean state flags are often checked in multiple methods.
  Clear predicate names make it easy to understand state transitions and dependencies throughout the class.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field to use an adjective or predicate that clearly expresses a binary condition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1517
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1517
```
