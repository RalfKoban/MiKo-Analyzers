# MiKo_1072: Name boolean properties or methods as statements, not questions

## Cause

A boolean property or method is named as a question rather than as a statement.

## Rule description

Boolean properties or methods define some state.
They should be named as statements and not as questions.
This makes reading easier, as boolean properties or methods are most likely used in if/else or switch statements.

### Rationale behind

Naming boolean properties and methods as statements instead of questions makes code more fluent and natural to read.
Statement-based names work better in conditional expressions, which are how boolean properties and methods are typically used.

When a boolean is named as a statement, the code flows more like natural language.
For example, `if (DeviceIsOnline)` reads like "if the device is online", which is more natural than `if (IsDeviceOnline)` which reads like "if is the device actually online?".

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Statement-based names make conditional expressions read more naturally, like sentences.
  The code becomes easier to understand at a glance.

- **Better Flow in Conditions**:
  When used in if statements, switch expressions, or other conditional logic, statement-based names create more fluent reading.
  The condition feels more natural and requires less mental processing.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  A statement directly describes the state being checked, making the code's purpose more obvious without extra mental translation.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to mentally rearrange the words to understand what the condition means.
  The name matches how people naturally think about states.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Following this pattern across a codebase creates consistency, making it easier for teams to read and understand each other's code.

- **API Clarity**:
  For public properties and methods, statement-based names make the API more intuitive and easier to use correctly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reformulate the property or method name as a statement.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1072
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1072
```
