# MiKo_2011: Do not falsely document unsealed classes as sealed

## Cause

The documentation for an unsealed class incorrectly states that the class is sealed.

## Rule description

Unsealed classes should not mention being sealed since they are not.
This keeps things clear and straightforward for developers.

### Rationale behind

Documentation must accurately reflect the actual state of the code.
When documentation incorrectly claims an unsealed class is sealed, it misleads developers and can cause them to make incorrect design decisions based on false information.

Accurate documentation about class inheritance capabilities provides several important benefits:

- **Truthful Information**:
  Documentation must be trustworthy to be useful.
  When developers find incorrect information, they lose confidence in the entire documentation and may ignore it altogether.

- **Correct Design Decisions**:
  Developers may choose different approaches based on whether a class can be inherited.
  False documentation about sealed status can lead to suboptimal architectural decisions.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  When documentation contradicts the actual code, developers waste time trying to understand why they can inherit from a supposedly sealed class.
  This confusion slows down development and creates frustration.

- **Maintains Consistency**:
  Accurate documentation ensures that what developers read matches what the compiler enforces.
  This consistency is essential for building trust in the codebase.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When documentation correctly reflects the code, maintenance becomes simpler.
  Developers can rely on documentation during refactoring without needing to verify every statement against the actual code.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Accurate documentation demonstrates attention to quality and professionalism.
  Inaccurate documentation suggests a lack of care that may extend to other aspects of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove any statements claiming the class is sealed from the documentation.

Ensure the documentation accurately describes the class without mentioning inheritance restrictions that do not exist.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2011
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2011
```
