# MiKo_3086: Do not nest conditional statements

## Cause

A conditional (ternary) statement contains nested conditional statements.

## Rule description

Nested conditional or coalesce statements are difficult to read and understand.
Avoid nesting them.
Instead, use if-else statements to improve clarity.
This approach keeps the code clean and maintainable.

### Rationale behind

Nested conditional statements create complex expressions that are extremely difficult to read and understand.
The ternary operator is designed for simple, single-level decisions, and nesting them violates this principle.

Avoiding nested conditional statements provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Code Confusion**:
  Nested conditional statements require developers to mentally track multiple levels of conditions and results simultaneously.
  This quickly becomes overwhelming and error-prone.

- **Improves Readability**:
  If-else statements make the logic explicit and easy to follow.
  Each condition and its result are clearly separated, making the code flow obvious.

- **Reduces Maintenance Errors**:
  When modifying nested conditionals, it is very easy to place code in the wrong branch or misjudge operator precedence.
  If-else statements make the structure explicit and harder to misunderstand.

- **Simplifies Debugging**:
  Debugging nested conditional statements is difficult because debuggers cannot easily step through the nested levels.
  If-else statements allow stepping through each branch individually.

- **Enables Better Testing**:
  Complex nested logic is harder to test thoroughly because the number of code paths grows exponentially with nesting.
  Flattening to if-else statements makes test coverage more manageable.

- **Communicates Intent Clearly**:
  If-else statements with well-chosen variable names or comments can explain the purpose of each condition.
  Nested conditionals obscure the intent behind layers of syntax.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the nested conditional statement into a series of if-else statements.
Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables to make the logic clearer.
Consider using switch expressions for multiple related conditions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3086
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3086
```
