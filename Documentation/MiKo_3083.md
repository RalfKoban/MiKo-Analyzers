# MiKo_3083: Use pattern matching for null checks

## Cause

A condition uses the equality operator (`==`) to compare with `null` instead of pattern matching.

## Rule description

Using `is` pattern matching for null checks is more natural and easier to read than the `==` equality operator.
This approach enhances code clarity and comprehension, making the code cleaner and more intuitive.

### Rationale behind

Null checks are one of the most common operations in C# code.
Using modern pattern matching syntax for these checks makes the code more readable and aligns with current C# best practices.

Using pattern matching for null checks provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Readability**:
  The pattern `value is null` reads more naturally in English than `value == null`.
  It clearly expresses the intent of checking for null in a more fluent way.

- **Prevents Operator Overload Issues**:
  Some types overload the `==` operator in ways that can cause unexpected behavior with null checks.
  Pattern matching always performs a true null check regardless of operator overloads.

- **Maintains Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching for null checks creates consistency with other pattern matching usage like type checks and constant checks.
  This leads to a more uniform coding style throughout the codebase.

- **Supports Language Evolution**:
  Pattern matching is the direction C# is moving for all kinds of comparisons.
  Using it for null checks prepares the code for future language features and patterns.

- **Simplifies Complex Checks**:
  Pattern matching can be combined with other patterns in switch expressions and conditional logic.
  Starting with pattern-based null checks makes these combinations more natural.

- **Follows Framework Guidelines**:
  Microsoft's coding guidelines and the .NET runtime code itself increasingly use pattern matching for null checks.
  Following this convention aligns code with the broader .NET ecosystem.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `value == null` with `value is null`.
Similarly, replace `value != null` with `value is not null`.
This applies to all reference types and nullable value types.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3083
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3083
```
