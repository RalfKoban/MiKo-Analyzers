# MiKo_2070: Do not start `<summary>` documentation with `Returns`

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation of a method starts with `Returns`.

## Rule description

If method documentation starts with `Returns`, it shifts focus to the return value rather than the method's purpose.
Instead, describe the method's intended function, not what it returns.
This ensures clarity about the method's primary responsibility.

### Rationale behind

Starting documentation with `Returns` focuses attention on the output rather than the method's purpose and behavior.
This approach makes it harder for developers to understand what the method actually does and when to use it.

Documentation should describe the method's action and responsibility, not just what it gives back.
When documentation emphasizes the return value, it can obscure the method's actual purpose and lead to confusion about its proper usage.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Understanding**:
  Describing what a method does rather than what it returns helps developers understand its purpose and when to use it.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  Action-oriented descriptions make it easier to find the right method when searching through documentation or IntelliSense.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Documentation that focuses on the method's purpose communicates the developer's intent more effectively than focusing on the result.

- **Consistent Documentation Style**:
  Using action verbs to describe methods creates a uniform documentation pattern that is easier to read and understand across the codebase.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Methods that perform actions should be documented based on those actions, making the documentation more precise and less open to misinterpretation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the `<summary>` documentation to describe what the method does instead of what it returns.
Use the `<returns>` tag to document the return value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2070
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2070
```
