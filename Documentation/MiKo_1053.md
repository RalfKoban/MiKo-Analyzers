# MiKo_1053: Do not suffix fields with delegate types

## Cause

A field name ends with a delegate type suffix.

## Rule description

Using the delegate type as a suffix for field names is redundant and unhelpful.
Instead, use descriptive names like `callback`, `filter`, or `map` to provide clearer context.

Field names should describe what they represent from a functional perspective, not simply repeat their type information.

### Rationale behind

Field names that end with delegate types like `Action`, `Func`, or `Predicate` provide no meaningful information about the field's purpose.
They merely duplicate type information that is already visible in the field declaration.

This makes code harder to read and understand because developers must infer the field's purpose from context rather than from a descriptive name.

Using descriptive field names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Descriptive names like `callback`, `filter`, or `validator` immediately convey the purpose of the field.
  Developers can understand the class structure without needing to analyze how each delegate field is used.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  When field names describe their purpose rather than their type, the code becomes self-documenting.
  This makes it easier to follow the class logic without constantly referring to type declarations.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When updating or debugging code, descriptive field names make it clear what role each delegate plays in the class.
  This speeds up maintenance work and reduces the chance of introducing bugs.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Names like `filter`, `predicate`, `mapper`, or `handler` communicate the role the delegate plays in the class.
  This makes the code's intent explicit rather than forcing developers to guess.

- **Enhanced Consistency**:
  Using meaningful names that reflect the delegate's purpose creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes it easier for developers to work across different parts of the application.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the delegate type suffix from the field name and use a more descriptive name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1053
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1053
```
