# MiKo_3061: Use proper log categories with loggers

## Cause

A logger is requested using a type parameter instead of a string category.

## Rule description

Loggers are often requested via a type, which results in logs lacking useful categories.
Developers might control log output using different severities (Debug, Info, etc.), leading to cluttered logs.
This makes it unclear which log statement belongs to which category.

Instead, request the logger via a string as the category.
This approach ensures clear and organized logs, making analysis easier and more effective.

### Rationale behind

Log organization is critical for understanding application behavior, especially in production environments.
Using types as logger names creates overly fine-grained categories that make log filtering and analysis difficult.

Using string categories for loggers provides several important benefits:

- **Logical Grouping**:
  String categories can group related functionality across multiple classes.
  Type-based categories tie logging to implementation details rather than logical concerns.

- **Better Filtering**:
  Logs can be filtered by feature or subsystem rather than by individual classes.
  This makes it easier to focus on specific areas of functionality when troubleshooting.

- **Reduced Clutter**:
  Fewer, well-chosen categories reduce log noise.
  Type-based logging creates as many categories as there are types, making logs overwhelming.

- **Stable Categories**:
  String categories remain stable even when classes are refactored or renamed.
  Type-based categories change with code structure, breaking log filtering configurations.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Category names can describe functionality rather than implementation.
  "Authentication" is more meaningful than "UserLoginService" when analyzing logs.

- **Easier Configuration**:
  Logging frameworks can be configured to route categories to different outputs.
  Logical categories make this configuration more intuitive and effective.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, request loggers using string categories instead of type parameters.
Choose category names that represent logical areas of functionality.
Use consistent naming conventions for categories across the application.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3061
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3061
```
