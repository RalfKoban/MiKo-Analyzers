# MiKo_2020: Use `<inheritdoc />` marker for inherited documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation contains only a `<see cref="..." />` reference to another member without providing actual content.

## Rule description

Using a `<summary>` documentation that solely references something else with `<see cref="..." />` is not effective, since IntelliSense does not display these descriptions.
For such cases, the `<inheritdoc />` tag should be used, as it is specifically designed for this purpose.
This ensures the documentation is properly shown in IntelliSense and makes it more useful for developers.

### Rationale behind

When documentation only contains a reference to another member, it provides no useful information in IntelliSense.
The `<inheritdoc />` tag is specifically designed to inherit documentation from base classes or interfaces and displays it properly.

Using `<inheritdoc />` appropriately provides several important benefits:

- **Proper IntelliSense Display**:
  The `<inheritdoc />` tag causes the actual documentation text to appear in IntelliSense tooltips.
  Simple `<see cref />` references show only the reference itself, which is not helpful.

- **Automatic Synchronization**:
  When base documentation changes, inherited documentation automatically reflects those changes.
  This eliminates the need to manually update documentation in multiple places.

- **Reduced Duplication**:
  Using `<inheritdoc />` avoids copying documentation between related members.
  This reduces maintenance burden and prevents documentation from becoming inconsistent.

- **Clear Intent**:
  The `<inheritdoc />` tag explicitly communicates that the member follows the contract defined by the base member.
  This makes the inheritance relationship clear to developers.

- **Better Maintenance**:
  When documentation is inherited rather than duplicated, there is only one place to update when behavior changes.
  This makes documentation easier to maintain over time.

- **Tool Support**:
  Documentation generation tools understand `<inheritdoc />` and can properly generate API documentation.
  Simple references do not work well with these tools.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `<summary>` containing only a `<see cref />` reference with the `<inheritdoc />` tag.

Use `<inheritdoc />` when the member implements or overrides another member and should share the same documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2020
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2020
```
