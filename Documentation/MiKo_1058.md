# MiKo_1058: Prefix dependency property keys with property names (as in the .NET Framework)

## Cause

A field that backs a `DependencyPropertyKey` is not prefixed with the associated property name.

## Rule description

To show that fields are keys for specific dependency properties, they should be prefixed with the property name.
This aligns with the naming conventions in the .NET Framework.

### Rationale behind

`DependencyPropertyKey` fields must be associated with their corresponding CLR property wrappers for read-only dependency properties.
Without a clear naming relationship between the key field and the property, it becomes difficult to understand which key belongs to which property.

The .NET Framework establishes the convention that a `DependencyPropertyKey` field should be named by combining the property name with the `Key` suffix.
Following this convention ensures the relationship between key fields and properties is immediately obvious.

Using property name prefixes for dependency property keys provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  When the `DependencyPropertyKey` field name matches the property name, the relationship is immediately clear.
  Developers can easily understand which key field backs which read-only property without searching through the code.

- **Better Framework Consistency**:
  WPF controls in the .NET Framework follow this naming convention for read-only dependency properties.
  Using the same pattern makes custom controls feel native and professional.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  When working with a read-only property, the naming convention makes it easy to find the corresponding `DependencyPropertyKey` field.
  This speeds up development and maintenance work.

- **Clearer Code Structure**:
  The naming convention creates a logical connection between related elements.
  For read-only properties, the pattern clearly shows the relationship between the property, its key, and its public `DependencyProperty` field.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When names clearly indicate relationships, developers are less likely to use the wrong key or property field.
  This prevents subtle bugs that can be difficult to track down in WPF applications.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, prefix the `DependencyPropertyKey` field name with the corresponding property name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1058
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1058
```
