# MiKo_6038: Place casts on same line(s)

## Cause

Type casts are split across multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when casts are placed on the same lines.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Type casts are a fundamental operation in C# that convert values from one type to another.
When casts are split across multiple lines, they become harder to recognize and understand, which can lead to confusion about the types involved.

Placing casts on the same lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The cast operation and the value being cast form a single logical unit.
  When they are on the same line, developers can immediately see what type conversion is being performed and on what value.

- **Clearer Type Information**:
  Keeping casts compact makes it easier to identify type conversions in the code.
  Developers can quickly spot where type changes occur, which is important for understanding data flow and potential type-related issues.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When a cast is on a single line, developers do not need to mentally combine information from multiple lines to understand the operation.
  This reduces the mental effort required to read and understand the code.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Compact cast operations are easier to review and verify during code reviews.
  Reviewers can quickly check that the correct type is being used and that the cast is appropriate for the situation.

- **Better Code Navigation**:
  When searching for type casts or specific type conversions, having them on single lines makes them easier to find.
  Developers can use text search more effectively to locate cast operations.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Treating casts consistently helps maintain a uniform codebase.
  This consistency makes the code more predictable and easier to work with.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the cast operator and the value being cast to the same line.
Ensure that the cast expression is compact and easy to read.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6038
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6038
```
