# MiKo_2006: Document routed events as done by the .NET Framework

## Cause

A routed event documentation does not follow the .NET Framework documentation style.

## Rule description

Routed events should follow the same documentation style as the .NET Framework.
This consistency ensures clarity, making it easier for developers to understand and work with these events.

### Rationale behind

Routed events are a specific feature in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and similar frameworks.
The .NET Framework uses a particular documentation style for routed events that developers have come to expect and understand.

Following the framework's documentation style provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework's routed event documentation follows a specific pattern.
  Using the same pattern makes custom routed events feel like native framework events, reducing the learning curve for developers.

- **Clear Identification**:
  Standard documentation helps developers immediately recognize routed events and distinguish them from regular events.
  This is important because routed events behave differently than standard CLR events.

- **Established Patterns**:
  Developers familiar with WPF already know how to interpret framework-style routed event documentation.
  Following the same pattern leverages this existing knowledge and avoids confusion.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  Consistent documentation style provides predictable information in IntelliSense tooltips.
  Developers know what to expect and where to find specific information about the routed event.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all routed events follow the same documentation pattern, it becomes easier to review and update event documentation.
  Inconsistencies are more obvious and can be addressed quickly.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Following established framework conventions demonstrates attention to quality and adherence to best practices.
  This makes the codebase appear more professional and well-maintained.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the routed event documentation to follow the .NET Framework style.

Include information about when the event occurs, how it routes through the visual tree, and reference the routed event identifier field.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2006
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2006
```
