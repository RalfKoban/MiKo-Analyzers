# MiKo_1038: Use consistent suffix for extension method container classes

## Cause

A class containing extension methods does not have a consistent suffix.

## Rule description

To make maintenance easier, classes with extension methods should all end with the same suffix.
This helps quickly identify their purpose and makes the code easier to work with.

Common suffixes include `Extensions` or `ExtensionMethods`.
Using a consistent suffix across the codebase makes it easy to find all extension method classes.

### Rationale behind

Extension method classes serve a specific purpose in the codebase: they provide additional functionality to existing types.
Using a consistent naming convention for these classes makes them easy to identify and locate, which improves code organization and maintainability.

When extension method classes follow a predictable naming pattern, developers can quickly find the extensions they need and understand where to add new extensions.
This consistency reduces cognitive load and makes the codebase more navigable.

Using a consistent suffix for extension method classes provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  When all extension method classes use the same suffix, developers can easily find them using IDE search or file explorers.
  Searching for `*Extensions.cs` quickly reveals all extension classes.

- **Clear Purpose**:
  The suffix immediately indicates that the class contains extension methods, not regular functionality.
  This helps developers understand the class's role at a glance.

- **Better Organization**:
  Consistent naming makes it easier to organize extension methods logically.
  Related extensions can be grouped in similarly named files.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When adding new extension methods, developers know exactly where to look for existing patterns and where to place new code.
  The consistent naming convention guides good organization.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Without a consistent suffix, static classes containing extension methods might be confused with utility classes or other static helpers.
  The suffix clarifies the class's specific purpose.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Consistent naming conventions signal well-organized, thoughtfully maintained code.
  They demonstrate attention to detail and architectural discipline.

- **Team Alignment**:
  A consistent suffix ensures all team members follow the same convention, making the codebase feel cohesive rather than fragmented.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the extension method container class to use a consistent suffix across the codebase (such as `Extensions`).

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1038
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1038
```
