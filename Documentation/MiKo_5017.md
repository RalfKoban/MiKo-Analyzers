# MiKo_5017: Make fields or variables assigned with string literals constant

## Cause

A field or variable is assigned a string literal but is not declared as `const`.

## Rule description

To avoid unnecessary memory consumption, make string literals used as field or variable values constant.
This keeps memory usage efficient and ensures better performance.

### Rationale behind

When a field or variable is assigned a string literal but is not marked as `const`, the compiler treats it as a regular variable.
- For fields, this means each instance of the class has its own copy of the string reference, even though all instances point to the same interned string.
- For local variables, the assignment happens at runtime even though the value is known at compile time.

Declaring string literals as `const` allows the compiler to optimize the code by embedding the value directly at compile time.
This eliminates runtime assignments and makes the code more efficient.

Making string literal assignments constant provides important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Optimization**:
  Constants are inlined by the compiler, eliminating runtime assignment operations.
  Non-const fields require runtime initialization even when the value never changes.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Marking a value as `const` clearly communicates that it will never change.
  This makes the code easier to understand and prevents accidental modifications.

- **Better Performance**:
  Constant values can be optimized more aggressively by the compiler and JIT.
  The compiler can perform constant folding and other optimizations that are not possible with variables.

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  For static fields, using `const` eliminates the need for a field entirely in many cases.
  The compiler embeds the value directly where it is used.

- **Thread Safety**:
  Constants are inherently thread-safe because they cannot change.
  Variables might require synchronization if accessed from multiple threads.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the field or variable declaration to use `const` instead of `var`, `string`, or field declarations.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_5017
#pragma warning restore MiKo_5017
```
