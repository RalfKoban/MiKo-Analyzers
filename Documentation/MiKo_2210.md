# MiKo_2210: Use term `information` instead of `info` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses the abbreviation `info` instead of the full term `information`.

## Rule description

XML documentation should avoid the abbreviation `info` and instead use `information`.
This practice ensures clarity and professionalism in documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and follow.

### Rationale behind

Abbreviations like `info` are informal and can make documentation appear casual or hastily written.
Professional technical documentation should use complete words to maintain clarity and formality.

While `info` is commonly understood, using the full term `information` shows attention to detail and respect for documentation standards.
It also ensures that documentation is accessible to all developers, including those who may be less familiar with informal abbreviations.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Enhanced Professionalism**:
  Using complete terms rather than casual abbreviations creates more polished documentation.

- **Better Clarity**:
  Full terms leave no ambiguity about meaning, even though `info` is widely understood.

- **Consistent Formality**:
  Professional documentation maintains a consistent level of formality throughout.

- **Improved Accessibility**:
  Complete terms are easier to understand for all developers, regardless of experience or language background.

- **Quality Standards**:
  Avoiding abbreviations demonstrates commitment to documentation quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace instances of `info` with `information` in the documentation.
