# MiKo_1044: Suffix commands with `Command`

## Cause

A command type does not end with the suffix `Command`.

## Rule description

To simplify maintenance, always add the suffix `Command` to commands.
This makes it clear they are commands and keeps the code consistent.

Using the `Command` suffix follows the Command design pattern and makes it immediately obvious which types represent commands in the application.

### Rationale behind

Command types represent executable actions in an application, typically following the Command design pattern.
Using a consistent `Command` suffix makes these types instantly recognizable and helps organize the codebase.

Suffixing command types with `Command` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Developers can easily find all command types by searching for classes ending with `Command`.
  This makes navigating large codebases much faster.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `Command` suffix immediately tells developers that this type represents an executable action.
  There is no ambiguity about the purpose or role of the class.

- **Consistency with Design Patterns**:
  The Command pattern is a well-known design pattern, and using the `Command` suffix follows established conventions.
  This makes the code more familiar to developers who understand common design patterns.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  When all commands follow the same naming convention, they naturally group together in file explorers and code navigation tools.
  This makes the project structure clearer.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to guess whether a type is a command or some other kind of object.
  The name makes its purpose explicit.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly identify command types and verify they follow the correct patterns and conventions.
  This speeds up the review process.

- **Framework Expectations**:
  Many MVVM and other application frameworks expect commands to follow this naming convention.
  Adhering to it ensures better integration with these frameworks.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the command type to end with the `Command` suffix.

For example, rename `SaveDocument` to `SaveDocumentCommand`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1044
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1044
```
