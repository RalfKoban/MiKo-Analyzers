# MiKo_6048: Place logical conditions on a single line

## Cause

Logical conditions are split across multiple lines when they could fit on a single line.

## Rule description

Logical conditions that span multiple lines are hard to read and understand.
To improve readability, they should span a single line only.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Logical conditions are the building blocks of program flow control, determining which code paths get executed.
When simple conditions are unnecessarily split across multiple lines, they become harder to read and the logic becomes obscured.

Placing logical conditions on single lines when they fit provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The entire condition is visible at a glance, making it easy to understand what is being checked.
  Developers can quickly evaluate the logic without scanning multiple lines.

- **Clearer Logic Flow**:
  Compact conditions make it easier to understand the control flow of the program.
  Developers can quickly identify what conditions trigger different code paths.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When a condition fits on one line, it can be processed as a single logical unit.
  Developers do not need to mentally combine pieces from multiple lines to understand the complete condition.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Compact conditions make it easier to scan through code and identify conditional logic.
  This is especially helpful when reviewing or debugging complex algorithms.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Simple conditional expressions read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows common programming conventions and makes the code more intuitive.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When conditions are compact, it is easier to evaluate them during debugging sessions.
   Developers can quickly understand why a condition evaluated to true or false without having to piece together a multi-line expression.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the logical condition to a single line when it fits comfortably.
If the condition is too long to fit on one line, consider refactoring it into smaller, more focused conditions or extracting it into a well-named boolean variable or method.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6048
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6048
```
