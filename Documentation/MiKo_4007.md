# MiKo_4007: Place operators before methods

## Cause

Operators are not placed before methods.

## Rule description

Operators are special static methods.
They should be placed before all other methods and grouped together.
This ensures clarity and makes the code easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Operators are a special category of methods that define how custom types behave with standard language operators like `+`, `-`, `==`, and `!=`.

Because they fundamentally extend the language syntax for a type, they deserve special placement that reflects their unique role in defining the type's interface with the language itself.

Placing operators before methods provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Type Capabilities**:
  When operators are grouped at the beginning, developers can immediately see what operations the type supports.
  This makes it easy to understand how instances can be used in expressions.

- **Better Discoverability**:
  Operators define fundamental type behavior that developers need to know about.
  Placing them prominently ensures they are not overlooked when learning how to use the type.

- **Improved Code Organization**:
  Grouping all operators together separates language-level functionality from regular methods.
  This distinction makes the code structure clearer and more logical.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all operators are in one place, it is easier to ensure they are implemented consistently.
  For example, developers can quickly verify that `==` and `!=` are both defined, or that comparison operators form a complete set.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers know exactly where to look for operator definitions.
  They do not need to search through all methods to find out if a particular operator is supported.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that operators follow best practices, such as implementing matching pairs (`==` with `!=`, `<` with `>`) and providing consistent behavior.
  The grouped placement makes these patterns obvious.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move all operator methods so they appear before regular methods in the class.

Keep all operators grouped together in one section for maximum clarity.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4007
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4007
```
