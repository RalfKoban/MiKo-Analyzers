# MiKo_1097: Do not use field naming schemes for parameter names

## Cause

A parameter name uses a field naming prefix like `_` or `m_`.

## Rule description

Parameters should not use the same prefixes as fields because that would be make them difficult to distinguish from fields.
Reviewers probably are not aware of such and might come to wrong conclusions when reading the code.

### Rationale behind

Using field naming prefixes (like `_` or `m_`) for parameters creates significant confusion about variable scope and purpose.
Fields use these prefixes to distinguish them from local variables and parameters, so when parameters use the same prefixes, this distinction breaks down.
Developers reading the code cannot easily tell whether they are looking at a field or a parameter, which can lead to misunderstandings and bugs.

Avoiding field naming schemes for parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  When parameters do not use field prefixes, it is immediately clear which variables are parameters and which are fields.
  This makes the code much easier to understand at a glance.

- **Better Readability**:
  Code is easier to read when each type of variable has its own distinct naming pattern.
  Developers can quickly scan through code and understand the scope and purpose of each variable.

- **Reduced Risk of Errors**:
  Clear distinction between parameters and fields prevents mistakes where developers might think they are using a field when they are actually using a parameter (or vice versa).
  This is especially important during refactoring or code reviews.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  Reviewers can more easily verify that parameters are being used correctly when they follow standard naming conventions.
  Unusual naming patterns are red flags that slow down review and increase the chance of missing issues.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When parameters follow standard conventions, future maintainers can understand the code more quickly.
  They do not need to learn or remember special naming schemes that deviate from common practices.

- **Consistency with Standards**:
  Standard .NET naming conventions do not use prefixes for parameters.
  Following these conventions makes code more consistent with the broader .NET ecosystem and easier for other developers to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the field prefix from the parameter name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1097
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1097
```
