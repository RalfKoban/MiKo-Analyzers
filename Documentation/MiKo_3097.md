# MiKo_3097: Do not cast to type and return object

## Cause

A method casts a value to a specific type and returns it when the method return type is `object`.

## Rule description

Casting a value to a specific type and returning it when the return type is `object` offers no benefit.
The cast is unnecessary and adds complexity without any gain.

### Rationale behind

When a method returns `object`, any value type or reference type can be returned directly without casting.
The cast to a specific type before returning serves no purpose because the return type is already the most general type possible.

Removing unnecessary casts provides several important benefits:

- **Simplifies Code**:
  Removing the unnecessary cast makes the code simpler and more straightforward.
  There are fewer operations for developers to read and understand.

- **Improves Performance**:
  While the performance impact is minimal, eliminating unnecessary cast operations reduces the number of IL instructions executed.
  This can have a small positive impact in performance-critical code.

- **Reduces Confusion**:
  Casts suggest that type conversion is necessary or that the compiler needs help determining types.
  Unnecessary casts can confuse developers who wonder why the cast is needed.

- **Makes Intent Clearer**:
  When code returns a value directly without casting, it clearly communicates that the value is being returned as-is.
  Casts can suggest that type transformation or compatibility issues are being addressed.

- **Prevents Cargo Cult Programming**:
  Unnecessary casts can be copied into other parts of the codebase, spreading the pattern without understanding why.
  Removing them prevents this anti-pattern from proliferating.

- **Simplifies Refactoring**:
  When return types change, unnecessary casts add extra steps to the refactoring process.
  Code without these casts is easier to modify when method signatures evolve.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the cast and return the value directly.
Since the method return type is `object`, any type can be assigned to it without explicit casting.
Simply return the variable or expression without the cast operation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3097
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3097
```
