# MiKo_3202: Use positive conditions when returning in all paths

## Cause

An `if` statement uses a negative condition when all branches return a value.

## Rule description

Code is easier to read when using `if` statements or conditionals with positive conditions.
This approach enhances readability and clarity.

### Rationale behind

Negative conditions require more mental effort to understand than positive conditions.
When all branches return values, using positive conditions makes the code flow more natural and easier to comprehend.

Using positive conditions in return paths provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Positive conditions are easier to understand at a glance.
  Developers do not need to mentally negate the condition to understand the logic.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Reading positive conditions requires less mental effort.
  The code's logic becomes more immediately obvious.

- **Better Comprehension**:
  Positive phrasing aligns with how people naturally think about conditions.
  This makes the code more intuitive to read and understand.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Positive conditions more clearly communicate what is being tested.
  The purpose of the condition is more obvious.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code with positive conditions is easier to modify correctly.
  There is less chance of logic errors when updating conditions.

- **Consistent Style**:
  Preferring positive conditions creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes the code more predictable and easier to navigate.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, invert the negative condition to make it positive.
Swap the `if` and `else` branches so the positive condition comes first.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3202
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3202
```
