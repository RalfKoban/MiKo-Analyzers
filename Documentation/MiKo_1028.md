# MiKo_1028: Limit local function name length

## Cause

A local function name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Local functions should have concise names since they are meant to encapsulate small, focused pieces of logic.
Excessively long local function names make the containing method harder to read.

### Rationale behind

Limiting local function name length is important because local functions are helper methods within a larger method scope.
They exist to break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces, and their names should be concise to avoid adding clutter to the containing method.
Overly long local function names can make the parent method harder to read and obscure the method's overall structure.

Local functions typically have a limited, well-defined scope and purpose within their containing method.
Their proximity to where they are used means the context is immediately available, allowing for more concise naming without loss of clarity.
When local function names are excessively long, they work against the goal of making the code more readable by adding unnecessary verbosity.

Keeping local function names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Method Clarity**:
  Shorter local function names keep the containing method clean and focused.
  Developers can quickly understand the method's structure without processing verbose helper function names.

- **Better Code Flow**:
  Concise local function names make it easier to see the overall logic flow of the containing method.
  The helper functions enhance rather than obscure readability.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  When local function names are appropriately brief, the code reads more naturally.
  The containing method remains the focus, with local functions providing supporting logic without adding clutter.

- **Clearer Context**:
  Local functions are used within a specific context where their purpose is already clear.
  Concise names take advantage of this proximity without repeating information that is obvious from context.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When local function names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand the helper logic.
  This makes it easier to understand how the containing method works.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Local functions with appropriately short names are easier to work with when refactoring or updating the containing method.
  Changes are more straightforward when local function names are not excessively long.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the local function name while preserving clarity within the containing method's context.

## How to suppress violations
