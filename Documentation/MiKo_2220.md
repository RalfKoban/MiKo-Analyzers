# MiKo_2220: Use `to seek` instead of `to look for`, `to inspect for` or `to test for` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains phrases like `to look for`, `to inspect for`, or `to test for`.

## Rule description

Phrases like `to look for`, `to inspect for`, or `to test for` all convey the same idea: to seek something.
Therefore, they should be replaced with the term `to seek`.
This streamlines documentation, making it clearer and more concise for developers.

### Rationale behind

Using varied phrases for the same concept creates unnecessary complexity in documentation.
When different developers use different terms for the same action, it can confuse readers and make the documentation harder to scan and understand.

Standardizing on `to seek` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  Using a single term throughout the codebase makes documentation predictable and easier to follow.
  Developers know exactly what to expect when they read the documentation.

- **Enhanced Clarity**:
  `To seek` is a clear, simple term that directly conveys the action being performed.
  It eliminates the need for readers to mentally translate multiple different phrases into a single concept.

- **Better Searchability**:
  When the same term is used consistently, it becomes much easier to search for related functionality across the codebase.
  Developers can quickly find all methods that seek for something.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Readers do not need to wonder if `to look for` and `to inspect for` mean different things or if they are just different ways of saying the same thing.
  Consistency reduces mental effort required to understand the documentation.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Consistent terminology demonstrates attention to detail and makes the documentation appear more professional and well-maintained.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace phrases like `to look for`, `to inspect for`, or `to test for` with `to seek` in the documentation.
