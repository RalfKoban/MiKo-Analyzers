# MiKo_2209: Do not use double periods in documentation

## Cause

The documentation contains double periods (..).

## Rule description

XML documentation is for other developers and should be clear and easy to read.
It must include all important information without any typos or confusing comments to avoid misleading developers.

### Rationale behind

Double periods in documentation are almost always typos or errors that make the documentation look unprofessional.
They can distract readers and reduce confidence in the quality of the code and its documentation.

Documentation should be carefully proofread and maintained to ensure it communicates clearly without errors.
Small mistakes like double periods may seem minor but they contribute to an overall impression of carelessness.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Error-free documentation demonstrates attention to detail and quality.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Correct punctuation makes documentation easier to read and understand.

- **Increased Trust**:
  Documentation without errors builds developer confidence in the codebase.

- **Better Communication**:
  Clean, error-free text communicates more effectively than text with typos.

- **Maintained Quality**:
  Catching small errors helps maintain overall documentation quality standards.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the extra period from the documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2209
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2209
```
