# MiKo_6010: Surround if statements with blank lines

## Cause

`if` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `if` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `if` statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear code structure and improving readability.
Conditional statements represent decision points in the code flow, and visually separating them helps developers understand where the code branches based on conditions, making the logic easier to follow and comprehend.

Surrounding if statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Decision Point Visibility**:
  Blank lines make conditional statements stand out as important decision points.
  Developers can immediately identify where the code flow branches based on conditions.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When `if` statements are visually separated, the code logic is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal transitions between different logical operations.

- **Better Code Structure Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the relationship between unconditional code and conditional branches.
  This makes the overall program flow clearer.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  Visually distinct `if` statements are easier to locate when navigating through code.
  Developers can quickly find conditional logic without scanning through dense code.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated conditional statements are easier to work with during debugging.
  Developers can quickly identify where decisions are made and which branch is executed.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When `if` statements are clearly separated, modifying conditional logic is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where conditional branches begin and end.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `if` statements.
Ensure each conditional block is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6010
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6010
```
