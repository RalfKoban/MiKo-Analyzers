# MiKo_1018: Do not suffix methods with noun of a verb

## Cause

A method name ends with a noun form of a verb when the verb itself would be more appropriate.

## Rule description

When naming methods, avoid adding a noun form of a verb at the end if the verb itself is appropriate as the method name.
This practice ensures method names are concise and clear.

For example, use `Calculate` instead of `PerformCalculation` or `DoCalculation`.
The verb form is more direct and easier to read.

Methods represent actions, so using verbs keeps the naming straightforward and aligns with standard naming conventions.

### Rationale behind

Using direct verb forms instead of noun forms for method names creates more concise, natural-sounding code that is easier to read and maintain.
When writing `Calculate()` instead of `PerformCalculation()`, the code reads more like natural language commands, improving comprehension.
Nominalized verbs (converting verbs to nouns like `calculation`, `validation`, `comparison`) unnecessarily lengthen method names and make them feel more abstract and less action-oriented.

This pattern also often leads to awkward constructions where a helper verb like `Perform` or `Do` must be added, creating redundancy (`PerformCalculation` means `perform-calculate`, which is repetitive).
Direct verb naming aligns with how developers naturally think about actions and makes code more intuitive.

Using direct verb forms provides several important benefits:

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Direct verb names read like commands.
  `Calculate()` is more natural than `PerformCalculation()` improving code comprehension.

- **Concise Method Names**:
  Eliminating nominalized verbs keeps names short and focused.
  This improves code scannability and reduces visual clutter.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Avoiding helper verbs like `Perform` or `Do` eliminates repetitive constructions.
  `PerformCalculation` redundantly says `perform-calculate`.

- **Fluid Method Chaining**:
  Direct verbs create smoother method chains.
  `item.Calculate().Validate().Save()` flows better than `item.PerformCalculation().DoValidation().PerformSave()`.

- **Action-Oriented Naming**:
  Direct verbs emphasize that methods perform actions.
  This aligns with how developers naturally think about method behavior.

- **Clean API Design**:
  Direct, imperative verbs create professional, expressive APIs.
  They feel more natural and easier to use.

- **Framework Convention Alignment**:
  The .NET Framework uses direct verbs (e.g., `String.Compare`, not `String.PerformComparison`).
  Following this pattern integrates custom code with platform standards.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to use a direct verb form instead of a nominalized verb with a helper verb.
