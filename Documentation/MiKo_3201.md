# MiKo_3201: Invert if statements in short methods

## Cause

A short method contains an `if` statement with a return that can be inverted.

## Rule description

If a method has just a few statements and an `if` statement that returns, invert the `if` statement.
This makes the method easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Short methods with guard clause returns can be simplified by using the guard clause pattern consistently.
This eliminates early returns in favor of a single code path and makes the method's normal flow more explicit.

Inverting `if` statements in short methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The guard clause pattern clearly shows when the method applies.
  The main logic is contained within a single conditional block.

- **Better Flow**:
  The inverted condition makes the normal execution path explicit.
  Guard clauses become positive conditions rather than early exits.

- **Single Exit Point**:
  Eliminates early returns in favor of a single execution path.
  Makes the method's control flow more predictable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, invert the `if` condition.
Move the `else` block (if present) to be the main method body after the guard clause.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3201
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3201
```
