# MiKo_1056: Prefix dependency properties with property names (as in the .NET Framework)

## Cause

A field that backs a `DependencyProperty` is not prefixed with the associated property name.

## Rule description

To show that fields are containers for specific dependency properties, they should be prefixed with the property name.
This aligns with the naming conventions in the .NET Framework.

### Rationale behind

`DependencyProperty` fields must be associated with their corresponding CLR property wrappers.
Without a clear naming relationship between the field and the property, it becomes difficult to understand which field belongs to which property.

The .NET Framework establishes the convention that a `DependencyProperty` field should be named by combining the property name with the `Property` suffix.
Following this convention ensures the relationship between fields and properties is immediately obvious.

Using property name prefixes for dependency properties provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  When the `DependencyProperty` field name matches the property name, the relationship is immediately clear.
  Developers can easily understand which field backs which property without searching through the code.

- **Better Framework Consistency**:
  All WPF controls in the .NET Framework follow this naming convention.
  Using the same pattern makes custom controls feel native and professional.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  When working with a property, the naming convention makes it easy to find the corresponding `DependencyProperty` field.
  This speeds up development and maintenance work.

- **Clearer Code Structure**:
  The naming convention creates a logical connection between related elements.
  This makes the code easier to understand and navigate.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When names clearly indicate relationships, developers are less likely to use the wrong `DependencyProperty` field.
  This prevents subtle bugs that can be difficult to track down.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, prefix the `DependencyProperty` field name with the corresponding property name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1056
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1056
```
