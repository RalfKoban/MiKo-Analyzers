# MiKo_2212: Use phrase `failed` instead of `was not successful` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses the phrase `was not successful` instead of the more concise term `failed`.

## Rule description

To make documentation concise and precise, use `failed` instead of `was not successful`.
This keeps it brief and straight to the point, making it easier for developers to understand quickly.

### Rationale behind

Wordy phrases like `was not successful` use more words than necessary to convey a simple concept.
Concise language is easier to read and understand, especially when scanning through documentation quickly.

The word `failed` is direct, clear, and universally understood in programming contexts.
Using simpler, more direct language makes documentation more effective and easier to process.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Shorter phrases communicate the same meaning with fewer words.

- **Better Readability**:
  Direct language is easier to scan and understand quickly.

- **Clearer Communication**:
  Simple, precise terms like `failed` leave no ambiguity about the meaning.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Avoiding wordy phrases keeps documentation focused and to the point.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  Developers can understand concise documentation more quickly while coding.
