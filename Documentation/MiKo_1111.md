# MiKo_1111: Do not suffix parameterless test methods with underscore

## Cause

A parameterless test method ends with an underscore.

## Rule description

Parameterless test methods should not end with an underscore.
The trailing underscore is reserved for parameterized test methods to distinguish them from regular tests.

### Rationale behind

Avoiding underscore suffixes on parameterless test methods is important for maintaining clear test naming conventions.

Keeping parameterless test methods without a trailing underscore provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Semantic Meaning**:
  The absence of a trailing underscore signals that a test method does not accept parameters, creating a consistent convention throughout the test suite.
  This makes the structure of tests immediately apparent.

- **Reduced Visual Noise**:
  Parameterless tests form the majority of most test suites, so keeping their names clean without unnecessary punctuation improves overall code readability.

- **Consistent Pattern Recognition**:
  When the underscore is reserved exclusively for parameterized tests, it becomes a reliable indicator that developers can trust and use to quickly scan test code.

- **Better Code Aesthetics**:
  Test names without trailing underscores look cleaner and more professional, especially in test reports and documentation where they serve as living specifications.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  If both parameterized and parameterless tests have underscores, the convention loses its meaning and creates confusion about which tests accept parameters.

- **Alignment with Community Standards**:
  Most .NET testing conventions use the underscore specifically to indicate parameterization, so following this standard makes codebases more familiar to other developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the underscore from the end of the parameterless test method name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1111
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1111
```
