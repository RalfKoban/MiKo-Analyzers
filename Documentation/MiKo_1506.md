# MiKo_1506: Do not suffix local variables with `Counter`

## Cause

A local variable name ends with `Counter`.

## Rule description

Local variables that hold values but are suffixed with `Counter` are most likely not holding counters but counted values instead.
So they should be named accordingly.

Using precise naming helps developers understand what the variable represents and improves code clarity.

### Rationale behind

Local variables are frequently read and referenced within method implementations.
Clear, accurate variable names are essential for understanding the logic flow without having to trace back to declarations.

Using appropriate naming provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Clarity**:
  When reading through a method, developers should immediately understand what each variable holds.
  `itemCounter` creates ambiguity about whether it is a `Counter` object or a count value.
  `itemCount` or `itemsCounted` is instantly clear.

- **Reduced Debugging Time**:
  During debugging, developers need to quickly identify which variables hold what values.
  Misleading names like `Counter` slow down the debugging process and can lead to incorrect assumptions.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Developers often scan code quickly to understand the overall logic.
  Accurate variable names support this scanning by eliminating the need to stop and figure out what each variable represents.

- **Fewer Naming Conflicts**:
  If you have an actual Counter class in your codebase, using `Counter` as a suffix for integer variables creates confusion and potential naming conflicts.
  Using `count` or `counted` avoids this issue.

- **Improved Collaboration**:
  When multiple developers work on the same code, clear variable names reduce misunderstandings and make pair programming more effective.
  Everyone immediately understands what each variable represents.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the local variable to replace `Counter` with `counted` or another appropriate term.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1506
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1506
```
