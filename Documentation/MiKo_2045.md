# MiKo_2045: Do not reference parameters in `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation references method parameters.

## Rule description

The `<summary>` documentation should not reference method parameters.
Its sole purpose is to provide a brief overview.
Including parameter details would be too specific for this high-level summary.

### Rationale behind

The `<summary>` tag is designed to provide a high-level overview of what a method does, not to explain the details of how it uses its parameters.
Parameter-specific information belongs in the `<param>` tags, where each parameter can be documented individually.

Keeping parameter references out of the `<summary>` provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
  The `<summary>` describes what the method does, while `<param>` tags describe individual parameters.
  This separation creates a clear documentation structure that is easier to navigate.

- **Better Abstraction Level**:
  A summary should describe the method at a high level without diving into parameter details.
  This helps developers quickly understand the method's purpose without getting lost in specifics.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Summaries without parameter references are shorter and easier to read at a glance.
  Developers can understand the method's purpose quickly from IntelliSense tooltips.

- **Consistent Documentation Pattern**:
  Following the convention of keeping parameters out of summaries creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes documentation more predictable and professional.

- **Proper Information Organization**:
  When parameter information is in `<param>` tags, documentation tools can present it appropriately.
  Developers can easily find parameter-specific information where they expect it.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  Documentation tools and IntelliSense are designed to display summaries and parameters separately.
  Following this structure allows tools to present information in the most useful way.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove parameter references from the `<summary>` documentation.
Keep the summary focused on describing what the method does at a high level.
Move any parameter-specific information to the appropriate `<param>` tags.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2045
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2045
```
