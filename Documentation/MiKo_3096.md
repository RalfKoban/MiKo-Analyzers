# MiKo_3096: Use dictionaries instead of large `switch` statements

## Cause

A `switch` statement has too many cases that map input values to output values.

## Rule description

For `switch` statements with many cases that map values, use a dictionary instead.
This approach makes the code easier to read and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Switch statements with many cases that simply map one value to another create verbose, repetitive code that is difficult to read and maintain.
Dictionaries provide a cleaner, more maintainable way to express these value mappings.

Using dictionaries instead of large `switch` statements provides several important benefits:

- **Improves Readability**:
  A dictionary clearly expresses the concept of value mapping.
  Each mapping is a simple key-value pair, while `switch` statements require case labels, return or break statements, and careful formatting.

- **Reduces Code Volume**:
  Dictionary initialization is much more concise than equivalent `switch` statements.
  This makes the mapping logic easier to understand at a glance.

- **Enables Runtime Modifications**:
  Dictionaries can be modified at runtime if needed, allowing for dynamic behavior.
  `switch` statements are compile-time constructs that cannot be changed without recompiling.

- **Simplifies Maintenance**:
  Adding or removing mappings in a dictionary is straightforward and less error-prone than modifying `switch` statements.
  There is no risk of forgetting break statements or misplacing code between cases.

- **Supports Data-Driven Design**:
  Dictionaries can be loaded from configuration files, databases, or other external sources.
  This enables data-driven behavior without code changes, while `switch` statements require code modifications.

- **Improves Testing**:
  Dictionary-based mappings are easier to test because the mapping data can be isolated and verified independently.
  Testing `switch` statements requires more complex code coverage analysis.

- **Allows Better Organization**:
  Dictionaries can be defined as class-level constants, organized into regions, or loaded from separate data files.
  Large `switch` statements must exist inline in methods, making them harder to organize.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the large `switch` statement with a dictionary that maps input values to output values.
Initialize the dictionary as a static readonly field or as needed.
Use the dictionary's indexer or `TryGetValue` method to retrieve the mapped value.
For cases where no mapping exists, provide appropriate default value handling.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3096
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3096
```
