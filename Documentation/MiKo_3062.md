# MiKo_3062: End exception log messages with a colon

## Cause

A log message that includes an exception does not end with a colon.

## Rule description

End log messages that log exceptions with a colon.
This clearly indicates that an exception follows, making it easier for developers to identify and understand the context.

### Rationale behind

Log messages that include exceptions need clear visual separation between the message text and the exception details.
A trailing colon serves as a consistent marker that exception information follows.

Ending exception log messages with a colon provides several important benefits:

- **Visual Clarity**:
  The colon provides a clear visual boundary between the log message and exception details.
  This makes logs easier to scan and understand at a glance.

- **Consistent Format**:
  Establishing a consistent pattern for exception logging makes logs more predictable.
  Developers can quickly identify exception entries in log files.

- **Easier Parsing**:
  Log analysis tools can more easily identify exception logs when they follow a consistent pattern.
  This enables automated log processing and alerting.

- **Improved Readability**:
  The colon indicates that additional information follows, preparing readers for exception details.
  Without this marker, the transition from message to exception can be jarring.

- **Professional Presentation**:
  Consistent formatting makes logs appear more professional and well-organized.
  This reflects positively on code quality and attention to detail.

- **Context Clarity**:
  The message before the colon provides context for understanding why the exception occurred.
  The colon links this context to the technical exception details.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure log messages that include exceptions end with a colon.
Add a colon to the end of the message string before passing the exception to the logging method.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3062
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3062
```
