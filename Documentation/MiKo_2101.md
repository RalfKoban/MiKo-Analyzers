# MiKo_2101: Show code examples within `<code>` tags in `<example>` documentation

## Cause

The `<example>` documentation does not properly enclose code samples within `<code>` tags.

## Rule description

For better readability, example documentation should enclose code samples within `<code>` tags.
This allows IntelliSense or any XML documentation tool to format them properly, making the examples easier to understand and visually distinct.

### Rationale behind

Code examples in documentation need to be clearly distinguished from explanatory text.
Without proper `<code>` tags, documentation tools cannot format the code correctly, leading to poor presentation in IntelliSense and generated documentation.

When code is not properly tagged, it may appear as plain text without syntax highlighting or proper formatting.
This makes examples harder to read and less useful for developers trying to learn how to use an API.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Better Formatting**:
  Documentation tools can apply syntax highlighting and proper indentation to code within `<code>` tags.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Clear visual distinction between code and text makes documentation easier to scan and understand.

- **Professional Presentation**:
  Properly formatted code examples look polished in IntelliSense and generated documentation.

- **Consistent Display**:
  Code tags ensure examples appear correctly across different documentation viewers and tools.

- **Enhanced Learning**:
  Well-formatted code is easier to read and copy, helping developers learn faster.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, wrap code samples in the `<example>` section with `<code>` tags.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2101
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2101
```
