# MiKo_6055: Surround assignment statements with blank lines

## Cause

Assignment statements are not surrounded by blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround assignments with blank lines to visually separate them from invocations.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Assignments and method invocations serve different purposes in code, and mixing them without visual separation can make it difficult to distinguish between state changes and operations.
Visual separation helps developers quickly identify where variables are being set versus where actions are being performed.

Surrounding assignment statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Separation**:
  Blank lines create clear boundaries around assignments, making them stand out from method invocations.
  Developers can quickly identify where state is being modified versus where operations are being executed.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into logical sections.
  Assignments that set up state become distinct from the operations that use that state.

- **Clearer State Changes**:
  When assignments are surrounded by blank lines, it is easier to track where and when variables change.
  This is especially important for understanding data flow and debugging unexpected values.

- **Easier Code Scanning**:
  Separated assignments are easier to spot when scanning through code.
  Developers can quickly locate variable modifications without having to carefully read every line.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Visual separation helps developers mentally categorize different types of operations.
  Assignments stand out as state modifications, distinct from method calls or other logic.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When assignments are clearly separated, it is easier to modify or reorder them without accidentally affecting surrounding logic.
  Developers can make changes to variable initialization with confidence.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after assignment statements.
Ensure that assignments are visually separated from surrounding method invocations and other code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6055
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6055
```
