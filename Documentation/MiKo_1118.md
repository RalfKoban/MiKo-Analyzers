# MiKo_1118: Do not end test method names with `Async`

## Cause

A test method name ends with `Async`.

## Rule description

Test method names should not include implementation details like `Async`.
The fact that a test is asynchronous is an implementation detail that should not be part of the test name.

### Rationale behind

Excluding `Async` from test method names is important for maintaining test stability and clarity.

Avoiding `Async` in test names provides several important benefits:

- **Implementation Independence**:
  The asynchronous nature of a test is an implementation detail that can change without affecting what the test validates.
  If the codebase evolves and a synchronous method becomes asynchronous (or vice versa), the test name should remain unchanged because the behavior being tested has not changed.

- **Reduced Coupling**:
  Including `Async` in test names creates unnecessary coupling between the test name and implementation details, leading to more refactoring work when implementation changes.

- **Clearer Focus on Behavior**:
  Test names should focus on what behavior is being verified, not how the test achieves that verification.
  Removing `Async` keeps the focus on the important aspects of what is being tested.

- **Consistent Naming Pattern**:
  Tests should be named for the business logic or requirements they validate, not the technical mechanisms used to execute them.
  This principle applies to all implementation details, not just asynchronicity.

- **Better Test Reports**:
  Test names without implementation details read more clearly in test runners and continuous integration reports, making it easier to understand what functionality is being validated.

- **Reduced Visual Noise**:
  Eliminating unnecessary suffixes makes test names cleaner and easier to scan, improving overall code readability.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Async` suffix from the test method name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1118
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1118
```
