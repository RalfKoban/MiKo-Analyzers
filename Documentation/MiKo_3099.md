# MiKo_3099: Do not compare enum values with null

## Cause

An enum value is compared with `null` using equality or inequality operators.

## Rule description

Comparing enum values to `null` is pointless because enums are value types and can never be `null`.
Such comparisons will always fail.

### Rationale behind

Enums in C# are value types, which means they cannot have a `null` value.
Comparing an enum to `null` indicates a misunderstanding of how enums work and creates code that will never behave as intended.

Avoiding null comparisons with enums provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Logic Errors**:
  Comparisons with `null` for non-nullable enums will always evaluate to false (for `==`) or true (for `!=`).
  This creates dead code paths or logic that never executes as intended.

- **Identifies Misunderstandings**:
  Code that compares enums to `null` suggests the developer might not understand the difference between value types and reference types.
  Fixing these comparisons helps identify and correct these misunderstandings.

- **Improves Code Clarity**:
  Removing meaningless null checks makes the code clearer by eliminating operations that serve no purpose.
  The code becomes more straightforward and easier to understand.

- **Reduces Maintenance Burden**:
  Future developers encountering enum null checks might waste time trying to understand why the check exists.
  Removing these checks eliminates this confusion.

- **Supports Proper Null Handling**:
  If nullable enum behavior is needed, the code should use `Nullable<TEnum>` or the `TEnum?` syntax.
  This makes the nullable nature explicit and enables proper null checking.

- **Prevents False Assumptions**:
  Code with enum null checks might lead developers to believe that the enum can be null in certain scenarios.
  Removing these checks prevents propagating this false assumption to other parts of the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the comparison with `null`.
If the intent is to check for a specific enum value representing an uninitialized or default state, compare with that specific enum value instead.
If nullable enum behavior is truly needed, change the type to `Nullable<TEnum>` or `TEnum?` and use proper nullable enum comparisons.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3099
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3099
```
