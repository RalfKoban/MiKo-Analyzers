# MiKo_1516: Express binary conditions clearly in boolean parameter names

## Cause

A boolean parameter name uses an abstract noun instead of an adjective or predicate.

## Rule description

Prefer naming boolean parameters using adjectives or predicates to express a binary condition rather than abstract nouns.
This improves code clarity, avoids ambiguity, and helps developers immediately understand the true/false nature of the value.

Using clear, descriptive names for boolean parameters makes code more readable and maintainable.

### Rationale behind

Boolean parameters control method behavior based on a true/false condition.
Their names should make it immediately obvious what passing true or false means, without requiring developers to read documentation or implementation.

Using adjectives or predicates provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Call Sites**:
  Method calls like `ProcessOrder(order, isUrgent: true)` are self-explanatory.
  `ProcessOrder(order, urgency: true)` forces readers to guess what `urgency: true` means.

- **Better Method Signatures**:
  Parameters like `bool includeArchived`, `bool allowNull`, or `bool throwOnError` clearly communicate their effect.
  Abstract nouns like `bool archive`, `bool nullability`, or `bool errorHandling` are ambiguous about what true or false does.

- **Reduced Parameter Mistakes**:
  When parameter names clearly indicate what true means, developers are less likely to pass the wrong boolean value.
  Ambiguous names increase the risk of logic errors.

- **Improved Code Documentation**:
  Well-named boolean parameters serve as inline documentation.
  Readers understand the method's behavior variants without looking up parameter meanings.

- **Better Refactoring Safety**:
  When boolean parameters have clear predicate names, automated refactoring tools and developers can more safely modify method signatures.
  Ambiguous names make refactoring risky.

- **Consistency with Named Arguments**:
  C# supports named arguments that make parameter names visible at call sites.
  Predicate names like `isRequired: true` read naturally, while abstract nouns like `requirement: true` do not.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to use an adjective or predicate that clearly expresses a binary condition.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1516
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1516
```
