# MiKo_2204: Use `<list>` for enumerations in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses manual enumeration markers like `1.)`, `2.)`, etc., instead of the `<list>` tag.

## Rule description

XML documentation should use the `<list>` tag for enumerating items.
Avoid using terms like 1.), 2.), etc., directly because IntelliSense and XML documentation tools cannot recognize these and may format comments awkwardly.
Using `<list>` allows IntelliSense to format content as tables, numbered lists, ordered lists, etc., making documentation clear and easy to read.

### Rationale behind

Documentation tools are designed to process XML tags and format them appropriately for different output formats.
When plain text markers like `1.)` are used, these tools treat them as regular text and cannot apply proper formatting.

The `<list>` tag is [specifically designed for structured lists](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#list) and enables documentation tools to render them correctly in IntelliSense, generated HTML documentation, and other output formats.
This results in much better visual presentation and readability.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Proper Formatting**:
  Documentation tools can render lists correctly with appropriate indentation and numbering.

- **Better IntelliSense Display**:
  Lists appear properly formatted in IntelliSense tooltips rather than as unformatted text.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Structured lists are easier to read than plain text with manual markers.

- **Consistent Presentation**:
  Lists appear correctly regardless of the documentation viewer or output format.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Using proper XML tags demonstrates knowledge of documentation best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace manual enumeration markers with the `<list>` tag and appropriate child elements.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2204
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2204
```
