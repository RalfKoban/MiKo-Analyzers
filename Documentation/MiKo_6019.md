# MiKo_6019: Surround continue statements with blank lines

## Cause

`continue` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `continue` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `continue` statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear loop control flow visibility.
Continue statements skip the remaining code in the current iteration and jump to the next iteration, and visually separating them helps developers understand where loop flow is interrupted, making the loop logic easier to follow.

Surrounding continue statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Control Flow Visibility**:
  Blank lines make `continue` statements stand out as iteration skip points.
  Developers can immediately identify where loop iterations are short-circuited.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When continue statements are visually separated, the loop flow is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that execution will skip to the next iteration.

- **Better Loop Logic Understanding**:
  Visual separation helps developers understand the relationship between the condition and the iteration skip.
  This makes it clear when and why certain code is bypassed.

- **Reduced Oversight Risk**:
  Visually distinct continue statements are harder to overlook during code reading or review.
  This reduces the risk of misunderstanding loop behavior.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated continue statements are easier to locate when debugging loops.
  Developers can quickly find iteration skip points to verify that loop flow is correct.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When continue statements are clearly separated, modifying loop control flow is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where iterations are skipped.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `continue` statements.
Ensure each continue statement is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6019
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6019
```
