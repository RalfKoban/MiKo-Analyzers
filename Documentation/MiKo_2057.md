# MiKo_2057: Do not throw `ObjectDisposedException` from non-disposable types

## Cause

A type that does not inherit from IDisposable documents throwing an `ObjectDisposedException`.

## Rule description

Types that do not inherit from `IDisposable` cannot be disposed.
Therefore, they should not document throwing an `ObjectDisposedException`.
This keeps the documentation accurate and logical.

### Rationale behind

`ObjectDisposedException` is specifically designed to be thrown when operations are attempted on disposed objects.
Only types that implement IDisposable can be properly disposed, so only these types should document throwing `ObjectDisposedException`.
Documenting this exception for non-disposable types is incorrect and creates confusion.

Avoiding `ObjectDisposedException` documentation for non-disposable types provides several important benefits:

- **Accurate Documentation**:
  Documentation should reflect the actual behavior and capabilities of the code.
  Non-disposable types cannot be in a disposed state, so documenting `ObjectDisposedException` is misleading.

- **Clear Type Contracts**:
  The IDisposable interface establishes a contract that includes the possibility of being disposed.
  Only types with this contract should document disposal-related exceptions.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  When developers see `ObjectDisposedException` documented, they expect the type to be disposable.
  Incorrect documentation creates confusion about the type's lifecycle and capabilities.

- **Proper Pattern Understanding**:
  Correct documentation reinforces understanding of the dispose pattern and which types participate in it.
  This helps developers write better code that properly manages object lifecycles.

- **Better API Understanding**:
  When exception documentation accurately reflects type capabilities, developers can better understand and use the API.
  This improves the overall developer experience.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `ObjectDisposedException` documentation from types that do not implement IDisposable.
If the type should be disposable, consider implementing IDisposable and properly supporting the dispose pattern.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2057
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2057
```
