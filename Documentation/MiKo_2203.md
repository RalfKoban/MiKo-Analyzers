# MiKo_2203: Use term `unique identifier` instead of `guid` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses the abbreviation `guid` instead of the full term `unique identifier`.

## Rule description

XML documentation should avoid using the abbreviation `guid` and instead clearly state `unique identifier` as they actually are globally unique identifiers.
This ensures clarity and precision, making the documentation more understandable and accessible for developers.

### Rationale behind

While `GUID` is a well-known term in programming, it is a technical abbreviation that may not be immediately clear to all developers.
The full term `unique identifier` is more descriptive and self-explanatory.

Technical abbreviations assume knowledge that not all developers may have, especially those new to .NET or programming in general.
Using clear, descriptive terms makes documentation more accessible and easier to understand.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Greater Clarity**:
  `Unique identifier` clearly describes what the value represents without requiring knowledge of the acronym.

- **Better Accessibility**:
  Full terms are easier to understand for less experienced developers and those learning .NET.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Using descriptive terms rather than acronyms creates more polished and professional documentation.

- **Improved Understanding**:
  Developers immediately understand the purpose and uniqueness of the value without needing to recall what GUID stands for.

- **Consistent Terminology**:
  Using full terms aligns with best practices for technical writing and documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace instances of `guid` with `unique identifier` in the documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2203
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2203
```
