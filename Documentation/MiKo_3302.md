# MiKo_3302: Use simple lambda expression bodies instead of parenthesized lambda expression bodies for single parameters

## Cause

A lambda expression with a single parameter uses parentheses around the parameter.

## Rule description

For single-parameter lambda expressions, avoid using parentheses.
Use simple lambda expressions with expression bodies instead.
This keeps your code cleaner and easier to read.

### Rationale behind

Parentheses around single lambda parameters are optional in C# and add unnecessary syntax.
Omitting them creates cleaner, more readable code that better expresses the lambda's purpose.

Using simple lambda syntax for single parameters provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Removing unnecessary parentheses reduces visual noise.
  The lambda's parameter and logic are more immediately visible.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Shorter syntax makes the code more concise.
  Developers can focus on the lambda's logic rather than ceremonial syntax.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Simple syntax makes the lambda's structure obvious at a glance.
  There is less to parse mentally when reading the code.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Omitting optional parentheses aligns with common C# style guidelines.
  This creates consistency across the codebase.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Simpler lambda syntax is easier to modify and understand.
  There are fewer syntactic elements to manage.

- **Modern Syntax**:
  Using minimal syntax represents current C# best practices.
  It keeps the code aligned with language conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the parentheses around the single lambda parameter.
Keep only the parameter name followed by the lambda operator and expression body.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3302
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3302
```
