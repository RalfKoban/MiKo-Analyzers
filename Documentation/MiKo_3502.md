# MiKo_3502: Do not suppress nullable warnings on Linq calls

## Cause

A LINQ method call that can return `null` has a nullable warning suppression operator (`!`).

## Rule description

Suppressing nullable warnings on LINQ calls that can return `null` confuses developers.
A value is either nullable or it is not; it cannot be both.

### Rationale behind

Many LINQ methods like `FirstOrDefault`, `SingleOrDefault`, and `LastOrDefault` can return `null` when no matching element is found.
Suppressing nullable warnings on these calls contradicts their documented behavior and creates false assumptions about nullability.

Avoiding nullable warning suppression on LINQ calls provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Safety**:
  Proper nullable handling forces developers to handle potential null values.
  This prevents null reference exceptions at runtime.

- **Better Type Accuracy**:
  The nullable type system accurately reflects that LINQ methods can return null.
  This ensures the type information is truthful.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Suppressing warnings suggests a value cannot be null when it actually can.
  This creates confusion about the actual behavior of the code.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Clear nullability contracts make the code easier to maintain and modify.
  Future developers will understand which values need null handling.

- **Correct Error Handling**:
  Acknowledging potential null values encourages proper error handling.
  This leads to more robust code.

- **Better Compiler Support**:
  Proper nullable annotations allow the compiler to provide accurate warnings.
  This helps identify potential null reference issues during development.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the null-forgiving operator from the LINQ call.
Handle the potential null value appropriately using null checks, null-coalescing operators, or nullable types.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3502
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3502
```
