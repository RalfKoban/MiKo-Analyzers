# MiKo_1066: Name constructor parameters after the property they`re assigned to

## Cause

A constructor parameter that is assigned to a property does not have the same name as the property.

## Rule description

To ease usage of a class, constructor parameters that get assigned directly to properties should have the same name as the property.
So a client of the class easily knows what the parameter is used for.

### Rationale behind

When constructor parameters match the properties they initialize, the relationship between them becomes immediately obvious.
This makes the code self-documenting and reduces the mental effort needed to understand how the constructor works.
Developers using the class can quickly see how constructor arguments map to object properties.

Naming constructor parameters after their properties provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Mapping**:
  When parameter names match property names, developers immediately understand which parameter sets which property.
  There is no need to read the constructor body to figure out the mapping.

- **Better IntelliSense Support**:
  When creating instances, IntelliSense shows parameter names that match the properties developers want to set.
  This makes the API more intuitive and easier to use.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  The constructor signature itself documents what each parameter does.
  No additional comments or documentation are needed to explain the mapping.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When parameter names clearly indicate which property they initialize, developers are less likely to pass arguments in the wrong order.
  This is especially important for constructors with many parameters.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  When property names change, it is immediately obvious which constructor parameters need to be renamed.
  The direct relationship makes refactoring safer and easier.

- **Consistency**:
  Following this pattern across all constructors creates a predictable codebase.
  Developers know what to expect when working with different classes.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the constructor parameter to match the property name (in camelCase).

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1066
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1066
```
