# MiKo_1010: Do not include `CanExecute` or `Execute` in method names

## Cause

A method name includes `CanExecute` or `Execute`.

## Rule description

Methods are meant to run code, so adding words like `CanExecute` or `Execute` to their names is unnecessary and repetitive.
It is like saying `executeExecute` - it does not add any useful information.

The fact that a method executes code is implicit in it being a method.
Including `Execute` in the name adds redundancy without improving clarity.

For command patterns, use simpler, more direct names that describe what the method does rather than stating that it executes.

### Rationale behind

Removing redundant terms like `Execute` from method names significantly improves code readability and follows the principle of meaningful naming.
Every method executes code - that is the nature of methods - so including `Execute` in the name is tautological.
This redundancy forces developers to read longer names without gaining any information about what the method actually does.

In command pattern implementations especially, method names should be action-oriented and describe the business operation being performed (e.g., `Save`, `Delete`, `Calculate`) rather than technical mechanics (e.g., `ExecuteSave`, `ExecuteDelete`).
Without the `Execute` prefix, method names focus on what they do rather than stating the obvious, making names more informative and purposeful.

Removing this redundancy provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Cleaner, more direct names improve code scannability.
  Developers can understand what code does at a glance without reading through redundant prefixes.

- **Natural Method Calls**:
  Method calls read like sentences describing business processes rather than technical implementations.
  `Save()` is more natural than `ExecuteSave()`.

- **Meaningful Names**:
  Without the `Execute` prefix, method names focus on what they do rather than stating the obvious.
  This makes names more informative and purposeful.

- **Better API Design**:
  Public APIs with concise, action-oriented method names feel more professional and easier to work with.
  They create a better developer experience.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Removing unnecessary prefixes reduces visual noise in the code.
  This makes the codebase cleaner and more pleasant to work with.

- **Clearer Boolean Methods**:
  For methods checking whether an action can be performed, standard prefixes like `Can`, `Is`, or `Has` are more appropriate.
  `CanSave` is clearer than `CanExecuteSave`.

- **Command Pattern Improvement**:
  In command pattern implementations, direct action names are more intuitive.
  The pattern already separates concerns - method names do not need to include technical details.

- **Industry Standards Alignment**:
  Well-designed .NET libraries use direct action verbs for method names.
  Following this convention makes custom code feel more integrated with professional standards.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to remove `Execute` or `CanExecute`, using action verbs or standard boolean prefixes instead.
