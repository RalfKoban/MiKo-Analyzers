# MiKo_2031: Use specific (starting) phrase for Task return value documentation

## Cause

A Task return value documentation does not use a specific starting phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation for a `Task` return value should start with a phrase that describes what the task represents and what result data it provides.
This helps developers quickly understand the purpose and output of the task.

### Rationale behind

Task return values are used extensively in asynchronous programming, and their documentation needs to clearly explain what the task represents and what result it provides.
Using a specific starting phrase helps developers immediately understand the asynchronous operation and its expected outcome.

Following a standard format for Task return value documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Asynchronous Intent**:
  Starting Task documentation with a consistent phrase makes it immediately clear that the method is asynchronous.
  Developers can quickly identify the asynchronous nature of the operation.

- **Better Understanding of Results**:
  Documenting what the task provides helps developers understand what data will be available when the task completes.
  This is crucial for properly consuming asynchronous methods.

- **Consistent Documentation Pattern**:
  Using a standard phrase for Task return values creates uniformity across the codebase.
  This consistency helps developers quickly locate and understand asynchronous operations.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Clear documentation of Task return values reduces confusion about what the method returns.
  Developers do not need to guess whether the method returns the task itself or the result contained within the task.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Consistent Task documentation makes it easier to maintain and update asynchronous code.
  Changes to asynchronous operations can be tracked more easily when documentation follows a predictable pattern.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the Task return value documentation with a phrase that clearly describes what the task represents and what result data it provides.
Ensure the phrase makes it clear that the return value is an asynchronous operation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2031
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2031
```
