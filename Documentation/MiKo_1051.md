# MiKo_1051: Do not suffix parameters with delegate types

## Cause

A parameter name ends with a delegate type suffix.

## Rule description

Using the delegate type as a suffix for parameter names is redundant and unhelpful.
Instead, use descriptive names like `callback`, `filter`, or `map` to provide clearer context.

Parameter names should describe what they represent from a functional perspective, not simply repeat their type information.

### Rationale behind

Parameter names that end with delegate types like `Action`, `Func`, or `Predicate` provide no meaningful information about the parameter's purpose.
They merely duplicate type information that is already visible in the parameter declaration.

This makes code harder to read and understand because developers must infer the parameter's purpose from context rather than from a descriptive name.

Using descriptive parameter names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Descriptive names like `callback`, `filter`, or `validator` immediately convey the purpose of the parameter.
  Developers can understand how the delegate will be used without reading the method implementation.

- **Better Self-Documenting Code**:
  When parameters have meaningful names, the method signature itself becomes documentation.
  This reduces the need for additional comments and makes the API easier to use correctly.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  When using IntelliSense or other code completion tools, descriptive parameter names help developers understand what kind of delegate they should pass.
  This speeds up development and reduces errors.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Names like `filter`, `predicate`, `mapper`, or `handler` communicate the role the delegate plays in the method.
  This makes the code's intent explicit rather than forcing developers to guess.

- **Consistency with Framework Guidelines**:
  The .NET Framework and many popular libraries use descriptive names for delegate parameters.
  Following this pattern makes code feel familiar and professional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the delegate type suffix from the parameter name and use a more descriptive name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1051
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1051
```
