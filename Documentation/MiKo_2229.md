# MiKo_2229: Remove left-over XML fragments from documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains incomplete or malformed XML fragments that should not be present.

## Rule description

XML fragments in documentation often go unnoticed by developers but can end up in publicly available documentation.
Therefore, it is best to avoid them to ensure clean, professional, and comprehensible documentation.
This approach keeps the documentation neat and free from unwanted remnants.

### Rationale behind

Leftover XML fragments are usually the result of incomplete edits or copy-paste errors.
They serve no purpose and actively harm documentation quality by creating confusion and appearing unprofessional.

Removing XML fragments from documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Documentation with XML fragments looks incomplete or broken.
  Clean documentation without fragments demonstrates attention to detail and quality.

- **Prevents Confusion**:
  XML fragments can confuse readers who are not sure if the fragments are intentional or accidental.
  This uncertainty undermines trust in the documentation.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  Documentation tools and XML parsers may have trouble processing fragments correctly.
  This can lead to rendering errors or warnings that distract from real issues.

- **Clearer Communication**:
  Documentation should communicate clearly without extraneous markup.
  Fragments add noise that makes it harder to find the actual information.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When documentation is clean and well-formed, it is easier to update and maintain.
  Fragments can interfere with automated tools and make manual edits more error-prone.

- **Public Documentation Quality**:
  If documentation is exposed publicly through generated API docs, XML fragments reflect poorly on the entire project.
  Clean documentation is essential for professional public-facing materials.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove any incomplete or malformed XML fragments from the documentation.
Ensure all XML tags are properly formed and serve a clear purpose.
