# MiKo_2022: Start `[out]` parameter documentation with default phrase

## Cause

Documentation for an `[out]` parameter does not start with the standard phrase describing the success case.

## Rule description

For `[out]` parameter documentation, start with the success case, such as `On successful return, contains...`.
This approach aligns with the .NET framework documentation and ensures clarity for developers.

### Rationale behind

Output parameters serve a specific purpose: they return additional values from methods.
Their documentation needs to clearly explain what value they will contain when the method completes successfully.

Following the standard `[out]` parameter documentation pattern provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework uses the phrase `When this method returns, contains...` for `[out]` parameter documentation.
  Following the same pattern creates consistency with framework APIs.

- **Clear Success Case**:
  Starting with the success case immediately tells developers what to expect from the parameter.
  This is the most important information developers need when calling a method.

- **Failure Case Understanding**:
  By establishing the success case first, the documentation can then describe what happens in failure scenarios.
  This complete picture helps developers handle both cases correctly.

- **Better Method Usage**:
  Clear `[out]` parameter documentation helps developers understand the complete behavior of methods that return multiple values.
  This leads to more correct and robust code.

- **Established Pattern**:
  Developers familiar with .NET know how to interpret framework-style `[out]` parameter documentation.
  Following the same pattern makes custom methods easier to understand and use.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Using standard phrases demonstrates adherence to .NET documentation best practices.
  This makes the codebase appear more professional and well-designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the `[out]` parameter documentation to start with the standard phrase.

Use phrases like `When this method returns, contains...` or `On successful return, contains...` followed by a description of the value the parameter will hold.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2022
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2022
```
