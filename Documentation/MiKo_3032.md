# MiKo_3032: Use `nameof` instead of Cinch for PropertyChangedEventArgs property names

## Cause

A `PropertyChangedEventArgs` constructor uses a Cinch helper to get the property name instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

Use the `nameof` operator for property names passed into `PropertyChangedEventArgs` constructors, instead of strings.
This avoids typos and invalid names and makes refactoring easier, as `nameof` ensures property names are automatically updated during renames, unlike strings.

### Rationale behind

Using the `nameof` operator instead of Cinch helpers or string literals ensures compile-time safety for property names.
String literals can become outdated when properties are renamed, leading to runtime errors that are difficult to diagnose.

Using `nameof` provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Verification**:
  The compiler verifies that the property exists.
  Typos or references to non-existent properties are caught immediately during compilation rather than at runtime.

- **Refactoring Safety**:
  When properties are renamed using refactoring tools, all `nameof` references are automatically updated.
  String literals remain unchanged, causing subtle bugs that only appear at runtime.

- **Better IDE Support**:
  IntelliSense and other IDE features work with `nameof`, providing autocomplete and navigation capabilities.
  String literals do not benefit from these development tools.

- **Reduced Maintenance**:
  Code using `nameof` requires less manual maintenance when properties are renamed or restructured.
  This reduces the time spent tracking down references and updating them manually.

- **Improved Reliability**:
  Runtime errors caused by misspelled property names are eliminated.
  This leads to more stable applications with fewer difficult-to-reproduce bugs.

- **Framework Independence**:
  The `nameof` operator is a built-in language feature that does not depend on external libraries like Cinch.
  This reduces dependencies and makes code more portable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace Cinch helper calls with the `nameof` operator.
Pass the property name using `nameof(PropertyName)` instead of using Cinch reflection-based helpers.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3032
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3032
```
