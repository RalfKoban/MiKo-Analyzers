# MiKo_2016: Start documentation for asynchronous methods with specific phrase

## Cause

Documentation for an asynchronous method does not start with a phrase indicating that it runs asynchronously.

## Rule description

Documentation for asynchronous methods should state that the method runs asynchronously.
Start with `Asynchronously...` to clearly convey this.
This ensures developers immediately understand the method's behavior.

### Rationale behind

Asynchronous methods behave differently from synchronous methods, and this distinction must be immediately clear in the documentation.
When developers know a method is asynchronous, they can use it correctly with await and understand its impact on application flow.

Clearly documenting asynchronous behavior provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Behavior Understanding**:
  Starting documentation with `Asynchronously` immediately tells developers how the method executes.
  They know to use await or handle the returned Task appropriately.

- **Prevents Misuse**:
  Without clear indication, developers might call asynchronous methods incorrectly, such as ignoring the returned Task or not using await.
  Clear documentation prevents these common mistakes.

- **Consistent Pattern**:
  Many .NET libraries document asynchronous methods by stating `Asynchronously` at the beginning.
  Following this pattern creates consistency across the codebase and with external libraries.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  When asynchronous behavior is documented clearly, reviewers can quickly verify that the method is being called correctly.
  This catches async-related bugs earlier in the development process.

- **Clear Threading Implications**:
  Asynchronous methods may execute on different threads or resume on different contexts.
  Clear documentation signals to developers that they need to consider threading and synchronization.

- **Improved IntelliSense**:
  When developers see `Asynchronously` at the start of the documentation in IntelliSense, they immediately know to use await.
  This speeds up development and reduces errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the method documentation to start with `Asynchronously`.

Rewrite the summary to begin with `Asynchronously` followed by the description of what the method does.
For example: `Asynchronously retrieves data from the database.` or `Asynchronously sends a notification to the server.`

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2016
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2016
```
