# MiKo_1033: Do not suffix entity parameters with `Model`

## Cause

A parameter name ends with the suffix `Model` when it represents an entity.

## Rule description

Adding `Model` as a suffix to a parameter name is unnecessary.
Just name the parameter plainly, like using `user` instead of `userModel`.
This keeps it simple and clear.

Parameter names should describe what they represent, not include implementation details or design pattern names.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing parameter names with `Model` creates unnecessary verbosity that makes code harder to read.
The parameter's type already indicates what kind of object it is, so adding `Model` to the name repeats information without adding value.

Clean, concise parameter names improve code readability and make method signatures easier to understand at a glance.
When parameters are named after what they represent rather than technical classifications, the code becomes more natural to read and aligns better with how developers think about the problem domain.

Removing `Model` from parameter names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter parameter names make method signatures easier to scan and understand.
  `Save(User user)` is clearer than `Save(User userModel)`.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The parameter type already shows it is a User entity.
  Adding `Model` to the name duplicates information that is already explicit.

- **More Natural Code**:
  Inside the method body, using `user.Name` reads more naturally than `userModel.Name`.
  The code flows better when parameter names are simple and direct.

- **Consistency with Conventions**:
  Standard C# naming conventions suggest using simple, descriptive names for parameters.
  Following this convention makes code more familiar to other developers.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  If architectural changes mean entities are no longer called "models", parameter names do not need updating.
  Names focused on domain concepts are more stable over time.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Parameter names should clarify the role or purpose of the argument, not describe its technical classification.
  `user` clearly indicates this parameter represents a user, without technical noise.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to remove the `Model` suffix, using a simple name that describes what the parameter represents.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1033
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1033
```
