# MiKo_2313: Format plain documentation comments as XML documentation

## Cause

Documentation uses plain comment syntax like `// Summary:` instead of proper XML documentation tags.

## Rule description

The API documentation for summaries should use `/// <summary>` instead of `// Summary:` because `/// <summary>` creates XML comments that the .NET compiler understands.
These comments show up in IntelliSense, help generate external documentation, and follow a structured format.

### Rationale behind

Plain text documentation comments like `// Summary:` are not recognized by the .NET tooling ecosystem.
They appear as regular comments and provide none of the benefits of proper XML documentation.

Using proper XML documentation format provides several important benefits:

- **IntelliSense Support**:
  Only XML documentation comments appear in IntelliSense tooltips.
  Plain comments are invisible to IntelliSense, making them useless for API consumers.

- **Documentation Generation**:
  Documentation generation tools can only process XML comments.
  Plain text comments will not appear in generated documentation, making them inaccessible to users.

- **Compiler Processing**:
  The C# compiler processes XML documentation and generates documentation files.
  Plain comments are ignored, losing valuable integration with the build process.

- **Structured Content**:
  XML tags provide structure with `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, `<remarks>`, and other elements.
  This allows for rich, organized documentation that tools can parse and present effectively.

- **Tool Validation**:
  IDEs can validate XML documentation, warning about missing tags or incorrect references.
  Plain comments receive no validation, allowing errors to persist.

- **Ecosystem Compatibility**:
  The entire .NET ecosystem uses XML documentation.
  Using plain comments isolates code from standard tooling and practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, convert plain documentation comments to XML documentation format using `///` and appropriate tags like `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2313
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2313
```
