# MiKo_3042: Do not implement interfaces in `EventArgs`

## Cause

An `EventArgs` class implements an interface other than standard framework interfaces.

## Rule description

`EventArgs` are standalone contracts.
They should not implement any additional interfaces.
This keeps their purpose clear and their usage straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
Keeps the code clean and maintains the integrity of the event handling mechanism.

### Rationale behind

`EventArgs` classes serve a specific purpose in the .NET event pattern: they carry information about an event from the raiser to subscribers.
When `EventArgs` implement additional interfaces, their role becomes unclear and the event pattern becomes more complex.

Keeping `EventArgs` interface-free provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Intent**:
  `EventArgs` that only carry data have an obvious purpose.
  Implementing interfaces suggests the object has responsibilities beyond event notification.

- **Simpler Event Handling**:
  Subscribers can focus on extracting event data without wondering about interface contracts.
  This makes event handlers more straightforward and easier to understand.

- **Reduced Coupling**:
  Interfaces create dependencies between event raisers, `EventArgs`, and subscribers.
  Standalone `EventArgs` keep these components loosely coupled.

- **Better Encapsulation**:
  `EventArgs` without interfaces clearly indicate they are data containers, not active objects.
  This prevents misuse and maintains proper boundaries between components.

- **Easier Testing**:
  `EventArgs` without interface requirements are simpler to construct in tests.
  Tests can create `EventArgs` instances without needing to satisfy interface contracts.

- **Maintained Conventions**:
  The .NET event pattern is well-understood and widely used.
  Deviating from it by adding interfaces makes code harder for other developers to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove interface implementations from `EventArgs` classes.
If the interface provides necessary functionality, consider redesigning the event to pass that functionality through other means.
Use composition or separate parameters instead of mixing concerns in `EventArgs`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3042
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3042
```
