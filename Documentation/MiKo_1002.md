# MiKo_1002: Follow .NET Framework Design Guidelines for event handler parameter names

## Cause

The parameters of an event handler do not follow the [.NET Framework naming conventions for event handlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/).

## Rule description

To follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines, parameters of event handlers should be named `sender` and `e`.

The standard event handler pattern in .NET uses two parameters:
- The first parameter is named `sender` and has type `object`
- The second parameter is named `e` and inherits from `EventArgs`

This convention is used throughout the .NET Framework and makes event handlers immediately recognizable.
Following this pattern ensures consistency and makes code easier to understand for other .NET developers.

### Rationale behind

The `sender` and `e` parameter naming convention is fundamental to .NET event handling and creates universal consistency across the entire platform.
This pattern appears in every framework event handler, from button clicks in Windows Forms to property changes in WPF, establishing it as one of the most recognizable patterns in .NET development.

When event handlers consistently use these names, developers can immediately recognize event handling code and understand the parameter roles without examining types or documentation.
The `sender` parameter represents the object that raised the event, allowing event handlers to identify the event source.
The `e` parameter contains event-specific data.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Instant Pattern Recognition**:
  - The `sender` and `e` signature is so well-established that developers immediately recognize event handling code.
  - This makes code reviews and maintenance significantly easier.

- **Clear Parameter Roles**:
  - The names immediately communicate what each parameter represents without needing to check types.
  - This clarity reduces the mental effort required to understand event handler implementations.

- **Better Code Reusability**:
  - Event handlers following the standard signature can be easily attached to different events or moved between classes.
  - This flexibility makes refactoring and code reuse much simpler.

- **Simplified Debugging**:
  - When all event handlers use the same parameter names, debugging tools and stack traces become easier to read.
  - Developers can quickly identify event handling code in logs and debug output.

- **Easy Code Search**:
  - The uniform naming makes it trivial to find all event handlers in a codebase through simple text searches.
  - This aids in understanding how events are used throughout an application.

- **Faster Learning Curve**:
  - New .NET developers learn this pattern once and can immediately understand event handlers anywhere in the framework or custom code.
  - Consistency eliminates confusion and makes the codebase feel unfamiliar or non-standard when different names are used.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the first parameter to `sender` and the second parameter to `e`.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_1002
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1002
