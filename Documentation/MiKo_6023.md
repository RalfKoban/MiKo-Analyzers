# MiKo_6023: Surround ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf statements with blank lines

## Cause

`ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround `ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding `ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf` statements with blank lines is important for maintaining clear parameter validation visibility.
These statements represent guard clauses that validate parameter ranges, and visually separating them helps developers distinguish between parameter validation and actual business logic.

Surrounding ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Validation Visibility**:
  Blank lines make guard clauses stand out as parameter range validation checks.
  Developers can immediately identify where range checks occur in the code.

- **Improved Code Readability**:
  When guard clauses are visually separated, the code structure is easier to read.
  The blank lines signal that validation is complete and business logic begins.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Visual separation creates distinct sections for validation and business logic.
  This helps developers understand the different purposes of each code section.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Visually distinct guard clauses are easier to identify during code review.
  Reviewers can quickly verify that appropriate range checks are in place.

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  Separated guard clauses are easier to locate when debugging argument exceptions.
  Developers can quickly find where range validation occurs to diagnose parameter issues.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When guard clauses are clearly separated, adding or modifying parameter validation is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where validation occurs.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after `ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf` statements.
Ensure each guard clause is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6023
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6023
```
