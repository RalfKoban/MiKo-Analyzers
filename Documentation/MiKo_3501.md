# MiKo_3501: Do not suppress nullable warnings on Null-conditional operators

## Cause

A null-conditional operator has a nullable warning suppression operator (`!`).

## Rule description

Suppressing nullable warnings on null-conditional operators confuses developers.
A value is either nullable or it is not; it cannot be both.

### Rationale behind

The null-conditional operator (`?.`) already handles null values safely by returning `null` if the left-hand operand is `null`.
Adding a null-forgiving operator (`!`) after a null-conditional operator sends conflicting messages about nullability.

Avoiding nullable warning suppression on null-conditional operators provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Code without conflicting null-handling signals is easier to understand.
  The nullability contract is clear and unambiguous.

- **Better Type Safety**:
  Proper nullable handling ensures the type system accurately reflects possible null values.
  This prevents null reference exceptions at runtime.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Mixing null-conditional operators with null-forgiving operators creates confusion.
  It is unclear whether the value can be null or not.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Clear nullability semantics make the code easier to maintain and modify.
  Future developers will understand the actual null-handling behavior.

- **Correct Nullable Annotations**:
  Avoiding suppressions encourages fixing the root cause of nullable warnings.
  This leads to more accurate type annotations throughout the codebase.

- **Better Compiler Support**:
  Proper nullable handling allows the compiler to provide accurate warnings.
  This helps catch potential null reference issues at compile time.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the null-forgiving operator from the null-conditional expression.
If the result should not be null, fix the nullable annotations or use appropriate null-handling patterns.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3501
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3501
```
