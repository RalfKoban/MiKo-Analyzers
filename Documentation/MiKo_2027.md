# MiKo_2027: Document serialization constructor parameters with specific phrase

## Cause

The documentation for parameters in a serialization constructor does not use the standard phrase.

## Rule description

To ease the usage, the documentation of the parameters of the serialization constructors shall have a specific phrase that describes what they contain.

### Rationale behind

Serialization constructors are special constructors used by serialization frameworks to reconstruct objects from serialized data.
They follow a specific pattern defined by the .NET serialization infrastructure, and their parameters have well-defined purposes.

Using standard phrases for serialization constructor documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework uses specific documentation patterns for serialization constructor parameters.
  Following the same convention makes custom serializable types feel like native framework types.

- **Clear Purpose Statement**:
  Serialization constructor parameters serve specific roles in the deserialization process.
  Standard documentation immediately communicates what each parameter contains.

- **Established Pattern**:
  Developers familiar with .NET serialization know what to expect from serialization constructors.
  Using standard documentation leverages this existing knowledge.

- **Implementation Guidance**:
  Clear parameter documentation helps developers implement serialization constructors correctly.
  This reduces errors in serialization and deserialization code.

- **Better Maintenance**:
  When serialization constructors follow standard documentation patterns, they are easier to review and maintain.
  Reviewers can quickly verify that the constructor is implemented according to best practices.

- **Compliance with Standards**:
  Proper documentation demonstrates adherence to .NET serialization standards and best practices.
  This is particularly important for types that will be serialized across boundaries or persisted to storage.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the serialization constructor parameter documentation to use the standard phrases.

- For the `SerializationInfo` parameter, use documentation like `The object that holds the serialized object data.`
- For the `StreamingContext` parameter, document it as `The contextual information about the source or destination.`

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2027
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2027
```
