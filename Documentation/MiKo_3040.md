# MiKo_3040: Use enums instead of booleans when more than 2 values might be needed

## Cause

A method parameter uses a `bool` type where an enum would be more appropriate.

## Rule description

To ease maintenance and improve readability, avoid using Booleans as parameters unless absolutely sure the value will never exceed two options.
Instead, use an Enum.
This practice ensures the code remains clear, flexible, and easier to maintain.

### Rationale behind

Boolean parameters can make code difficult to read at call sites because the meaning of `true` or `false` is not immediately obvious.
Additionally, if requirements change and a third option becomes necessary, boolean parameters require significant refactoring.

Using enums instead of booleans provides several important benefits:

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Enum values have meaningful names that make code readable at call sites.
  `DoSomething(ProcessingMode.Parallel)` is clearer than `DoSomething(true)`.

- **Easier Extension**:
  When a third option becomes necessary, enums can accommodate it without breaking existing code.
  Boolean parameters require changing the method signature and updating all callers.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  IDEs show available enum values, helping developers choose the correct option.
  Boolean parameters offer only `true` and `false` without indicating what they mean in context.

- **Compile-Time Safety**:
  Enums prevent invalid values from being passed.
  Boolean parameters might be used incorrectly when their meaning is unclear.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Enum names can be updated if terminology changes, with refactoring tools updating all usages.
  The meaning of boolean parameters is scattered across documentation and caller understanding.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Developers cannot accidentally swap boolean parameters when multiple exist.
  Enums with distinct types prevent this entire class of errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace boolean parameters with enum types.
Create an enum with descriptive names for each option.
Update the method signature and all callers to use the new enum type.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3040
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3040
```
