# MiKo_6071: Surround local using statements with blank lines

## Cause

Local `using` statements are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround local `using` statements with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding local `using` statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear code organization and readability.
Local `using` statements introduce resource management concerns that are distinct from the business logic, and visually separating them helps developers understand the scope and lifecycle of disposable resources.

Surrounding local `using` statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Resource Scope Visibility**:
  Blank lines make the boundaries of resource management clear.
  Developers can immediately see where resources are acquired and where they are automatically disposed.

- **Improved Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into distinct sections.
  Resource management code is clearly distinguished from business logic.

- **Better Readability**:
  When `using` statements are surrounded by blank lines, the code flow is easier to follow.
  The visual breaks help developers understand the structure without having to analyze indentation carefully.

- **Easier Resource Tracking**:
  Separated `using` statements are easier to identify when tracking resource allocation and disposal.
  This is particularly important for debugging resource leaks or lifetime issues.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When `using` statements are clearly separated, modifying resource management code is simpler.
  The boundaries make it obvious what code is related to resource handling.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Visual separation reduces the mental effort required to understand code structure.
  Developers can quickly distinguish between resource management and business logic without detailed analysis.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after local `using` statements.
Ensure each `using` block is visually separated from the surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6071
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6071
```
