# MiKo_3036: Use `TimeSpan` factory methods instead of constructors

## Cause

Code uses a `TimeSpan` constructor instead of a factory method.

## Rule description

The `TimeSpan` .NET struct has many constructors with varying parameters, making its invocations hard to read.
Instead, prefer static factory methods like `FromMinutes` or `FromDays`.
These are more explicit and easier to understand.

Please note:
It would be even better to use extension methods like `Minutes()` or `Days()`.
This approach allows for more natural usage, such as ` var x = 5.Days(); `.

### Rationale behind

The `TimeSpan` constructors accept multiple parameters representing different time units, but the parameter order and meaning are not immediately obvious.
This can lead to confusion and errors when reading or writing code.

Using factory methods provides several important benefits:

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Factory method names clearly indicate the time unit being used.
  `TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)` is immediately understandable, while `new TimeSpan(0, 5, 0)` requires mental translation.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Developers cannot accidentally swap parameters or use the wrong units.
  Constructor parameters like `new TimeSpan(hours, minutes, seconds)` are easy to mix up.

- **Better Readability**:
  Code reviewers and maintainers can quickly understand the intended duration.
  This reduces the cognitive load when reading code.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When durations need to change, the intent remains clear in the code.
  Changing `FromHours(2)` to `FromHours(3)` is more obvious than changing constructor parameters.

- **Consistent Style**:
  Using factory methods establishes a consistent pattern across the codebase.
  This makes the code more predictable and easier to work with.

- **IntelliSense Support**:
  Factory methods are easier to discover through IntelliSense.
  Developers can see all available time units without needing to remember constructor overloads.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `TimeSpan` constructor calls with appropriate factory methods.
Use `TimeSpan.FromDays()`, `TimeSpan.FromHours()`, `TimeSpan.FromMinutes()`, `TimeSpan.FromSeconds()`, or `TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds()` depending on the time unit.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3036
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3036
```
