# MiKo_1119: Do not include 'when_present' in test method names

## Cause

A test method name contains terms such as 'when_present', 'if_present', 'when_not_present', or 'if_not_present' (in various casings).

## Rule description

Test method names should be clear and meaningful.
The terms 'when_present' or 'if_present' do not add useful information and make tests harder to understand.
Use descriptive names that explain the behavior being tested instead.

### Rationale behind

Using vague condition indicators in test names reduces the clarity and maintainability of the test suite.
When tests fail, developers need to quickly understand what scenario is failing without having to read the test implementation.
Generic terms like `when_present` force developers to investigate the test code to determine what is actually present.

Often, the `when_present` suffix is entirely redundant because the test scenario inherently requires the element to exist.
If a test is checking behavior on an element, that element must be present for the test to be meaningful.
Adding `when_present` does not add information but instead clutters the test name.

Clear and specific test names provide several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Explicit test names immediately communicate what is being tested.
  Developers can understand the test scenario at a glance without needing to examine the test implementation.

- **Better Debugging**:
  When a test fails, a descriptive name helps identify the exact scenario that is not working.
  This reduces the time needed to locate and fix issues.

- **Enhanced Documentation**:
  Test names serve as living documentation for the system's behavior.
  Specific names document what scenarios the code handles and what conditions are supported.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Clear test names make it easier to understand the test suite's coverage.
  Developers can quickly identify gaps in testing or redundant tests.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Descriptive names eliminate the need to remember what 'present' refers to in each context.
  Each test name stands on its own without requiring additional context.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test method to explicitly describe what element or condition is being tested and what behavior is expected.

Replace generic presence indicators with specific terms that describe what is being checked.
Focus on making the test name self-explanatory by including the relevant context.

Common patterns to recognize:

- `Method_does_something_when_present` → `Method_does_something` (when the presence is implied by the action)
- `Method_acts_on_element_when_present` → `Method_acts_on_existing_element` (when emphasizing existence is important)
- `Method_skips_when_not_present` → `Method_skips_for_missing_element` (when testing the absence scenario)

Consider including information about:

- What specific element exists or is present (if not already clear from the action)
- What the expected behavior or outcome is
- What condition or state is being verified

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
# pragma warning disable MiKo_1119
# pragma warning restore MiKo_1119
