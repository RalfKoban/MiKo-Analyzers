# MiKo_3123: Do not catch exceptions in test methods

## Cause

A test method contains a try-catch block that catches exceptions.

## Rule description

Avoid catching exceptions in test methods.
Catching exceptions can hide test failures and lead to false positives.
Let the test framework handle unexpected exceptions to ensure accurate and reliable test results.

### Rationale behind

Test frameworks are designed to catch and report exceptions automatically, providing detailed information about test failures.
When tests catch exceptions manually, they interfere with this mechanism and can hide important problems.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Prevents Hidden Failures**:
  Catching exceptions can mask test failures, allowing tests to pass when they should fail.
  The test framework needs to see exceptions to properly report failures.

- **Better Failure Reporting**:
  Test frameworks provide detailed stack traces and failure information for unhandled exceptions.
  Caught exceptions lose this context, making debugging harder.

- **Accurate Test Results**:
  Tests that catch exceptions might report success even when the code under test fails.
  This creates false confidence in code quality.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Tests without exception handling clearly express expected behavior.
  Try-catch blocks suggest that exceptions are expected, which may not be the actual intent.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  Unhandled exceptions in tests immediately show where and why the failure occurred.
  Caught exceptions require additional investigation to understand the root cause.

- **Proper Exception Testing**:
  When tests need to verify exception behavior, frameworks provide dedicated assertion methods.
  These methods are clearer and more reliable than manual try-catch blocks.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the try-catch block and use test framework features like `Assert.Throws` or `[ExpectedException]` when testing for expected exceptions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3123
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3123
```
