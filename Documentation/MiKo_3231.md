# MiKo_3231: Use pattern matching for ordinal string comparison equality checks

## Cause

A string equality check uses `Equals(StringComparison.Ordinal)` instead of pattern matching.

## Rule description

Equality checks using `is` pattern matching are more intuitive and easier to read than the `Equals(StringComparison.Ordinal)` comparison.
This makes them the preferred choice for clarity and comprehension.

### Rationale behind

The `Equals` method with `StringComparison.Ordinal` is verbose and less readable than pattern matching.
For simple ordinal equality checks, pattern matching provides a cleaner syntax that better expresses intent.

Using pattern matching for ordinal string comparisons provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Pattern matching syntax is more concise than method calls with comparison parameters.
  The code reads more naturally and is easier to understand at a glance.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Eliminating the `StringComparison.Ordinal` parameter reduces visual noise.
  The code becomes cleaner and more focused on the actual comparison.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching aligns with equality checks on other types.
  This creates a consistent style across the codebase.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Pattern matching makes the equality check explicit and obvious.
  Developers can quickly understand what is being compared.

- **Modern Syntax**:
  Pattern matching represents modern C# best practices.
  Using it keeps the code aligned with current language evolution.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Simpler syntax is easier to modify and less prone to errors during updates.
  There are fewer method parameters to manage.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `Equals(StringComparison.Ordinal)` method call with pattern matching syntax.
Use the `is` operator for equality checks when ordinal comparison is appropriate.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3231
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3231
```
