# MiKo_2040: Use `<see langword="..."/>` instead of `<c>...</c>`

## Cause

The documentation uses `<c>...</c>` for language keywords instead of `<see langword="..."/>`.

## Rule description

To support other .NET languages beyond C#, documentation should use `<see langword="..."/>` instead of `<c>...</c>`. This ensures that language-specific terms are accurately translated into the correct terminology for each language, making the codebase more inclusive and accessible to non-C# developers.

### Rationale behind

.NET supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Visual Basic, and F#.
Using the correct XML documentation tags ensures that documentation tools can properly translate language keywords into the appropriate terminology for each language.

Using `<see langword="..."/>` for language keywords provides several important benefits:

- **Multi-Language Support**:
  The `<see langword="..."/>` tag allows documentation tools to translate keywords into the appropriate language-specific term.
  For example, `null` in C# becomes `Nothing` in Visual Basic when properly tagged.

- **Better Tool Integration**:
  Documentation generation tools and IntelliSense can properly recognize and format language keywords when they are marked with `<see langword="..."/>`.
  This improves the overall documentation presentation.

- **Consistent Styling**:
  Language keywords marked with `<see langword="..."/>` are consistently styled across different documentation viewers and IDEs.
  This creates a more professional and polished documentation experience.

- **Semantic Correctness**:
  Using the correct tag for language keywords provides semantic meaning to the documentation.
  Tools can understand that the term is a language keyword, not just formatted code.

- **Cross-Language Compatibility**:
  When documentation is properly tagged, developers using different .NET languages can read and understand the documentation in their preferred language's terminology.
  This makes the codebase more accessible to a wider audience.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `<c>...</c>` tags with `<see langword="..."/>` when documenting language keywords such as null, true, false, async, await, and other language-specific terms.
Ensure that only actual language keywords are marked with the langword tag.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2040
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2040
```
