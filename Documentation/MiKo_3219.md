# MiKo_3219: Do not mark public members as `virtual`

## Cause

A public member is marked as `virtual`.

## Rule description

Public members should offer the correct functionality for class consumers.
If extensibility is needed, they should call a `protected virtual` member with the same name suffixed by `Core`.
These serve as clear, easily identifiable extensibility points.

### Rationale behind

Making public members virtual exposes implementation details to consumers and allows them to change fundamental behavior.
This can lead to fragile base class problems where changes to derived classes break the contract expected by consumers.

Using protected virtual Core methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Encapsulation**:
  Public members define the contract while protected members provide extensibility.
  Implementation details are hidden from consumers.

- **Better Stability**:
  Public API remains stable while allowing customization through protected members.
  Changes to override behavior do not affect the public contract.

- **Clearer Separation**:
  The pattern clearly separates the public contract from extensibility points.
  Developers understand which aspects can be customized.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Public members can add validation or pre/post-processing around the virtual Core method.
  This ensures the contract is always maintained.

- **Prevented Errors**:
  Derived classes cannot accidentally violate the public contract.
  The base class retains control over the public behavior.

- **Better Design**:
  The pattern encourages proper API design with clear contracts.
  Extensibility is intentional rather than accidental.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, make the public member non-virtual.
Create a protected virtual method with the same name suffixed by `Core`.
Have the public member call the protected Core method, adding any necessary validation or pre/post-processing.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3219
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3219
```
