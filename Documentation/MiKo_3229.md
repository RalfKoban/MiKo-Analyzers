# MiKo_3229: Use `KeyValuePair.Create` instead of constructors

## Cause

A `KeyValuePair` is created using the constructor instead of the `KeyValuePair.Create` factory method.

## Rule description

Prefer `KeyValuePair.Create(...)` over the constructor to benefit from type inference, reduce verbosity, and improve code readability.
This approach aligns with modern C# practices and promotes consistency with other factory methods like `Tuple.Create`.
It also simplifies usage in `var` declarations by avoiding redundant type specifications.

### Rationale behind

The `KeyValuePair` constructor requires explicit type arguments, which can make the code verbose and harder to read.
The `Create` factory method uses type inference to determine types from the arguments, making the code more concise.

Using `KeyValuePair.Create` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The factory method eliminates the need to specify type arguments explicitly.
  This reduces visual clutter and makes the code easier to scan.

- **Type Inference**:
  The compiler infers types from the arguments automatically.
  This reduces redundancy when the types are obvious from context.

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Shorter syntax makes the code more concise without sacrificing clarity.
  Developers can focus on the values being paired rather than type specifications.

- **Better with `var`**:
  The factory method works seamlessly with `var` declarations.
  This avoids repeating type information on both sides of the assignment.

- **Consistency**:
  Using factory methods aligns with common .NET patterns like `Tuple.Create`.
  This creates consistency across the codebase.

- **Modern Syntax**:
  Factory methods represent modern C# best practices.
  Using them keeps the code aligned with current language conventions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `KeyValuePair` constructor with the `KeyValuePair.Create` factory method.
Pass the key and value as arguments, allowing the compiler to infer the types.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3229
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3229
```
