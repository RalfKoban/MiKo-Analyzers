# MiKo_1083: Do not suffix fields with a number if their types have number suffixes

## Cause

A field name ends with a number, and its type also has a number suffix.

## Rule description

Field names should not repeat the number suffix from their type name.
When a type already contains a number (like `IProjectManager42`), the field name should omit that number (use `_projectManager` instead of `_projectManager42`).
The type name already conveys the numeric context, so repeating it in the field name adds no value and reduces clarity.

### Rationale behind

When both the field name and type name contain the same number, it creates unnecessary redundancy that makes code harder to read.
For example, `_projectManager42` of type `IProjectManager42` repeats the `42` information twice without adding any meaningful distinction.
The type name already indicates the version or variant, so the field name can simply be `_projectManager`.

Removing redundant number suffixes from field names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter, cleaner field names are easier to read and understand.
  `_projectManager` is clearer than `_projectManager42` when the type is already `IProjectManager42`.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The type already indicates the version, dimensionality, or variant through its number suffix.
  Repeating it in the field name serves no purpose and just adds noise.

- **Natural Language Flow**:
  Code reads more naturally when fields have simple, direct names.
  `_projectManager.OpenProject()` flows better than `_projectManager42.OpenProject()`.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  If the type changes from `IProjectManager42` to `IProjectManager43`, a field named `_projectManager` does not need to be renamed.
  A field named `_projectManager42` would need updating throughout the codebase.

- **Consistent Naming**:
  Following standard naming conventions makes the codebase more predictable and easier to navigate.
  Fields should describe what they represent, not repeat type information.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The field name should focus on its role or purpose, not duplicate implementation details already expressed in the type.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the number from the field name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1083
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1083
```
