# MiKo_6049: Surround event (un-)registrations with blank lines

## Cause

Event registrations or un-registrations are not surrounded by blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround event registrations and un-registrations with blank lines to visually separate them from other code.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Event registrations and un-registrations are important points in code where event handlers are attached or detached from events.
When they are not visually separated from surrounding code, they can be easily overlooked or confused with other operations.

Surrounding event registrations and un-registrations with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Separation**:
  Blank lines create clear boundaries around event-related code, making it stand out from surrounding logic.
  Developers can quickly identify where events are being wired up or disconnected.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize code into logical sections.
  Event setup and teardown becomes distinct from business logic, initialization, or other operations.

- **Easier Code Scanning**:
  When event registrations are surrounded by blank lines, they are easier to spot when scanning through code.
  This is especially helpful when looking for potential memory leaks caused by events that are registered but not unregistered.

- **Clearer Event Management**:
  Separating event operations makes it easier to verify that events are properly registered and unregistered.
  Developers can quickly check that event lifecycle is correctly managed.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Visual separation helps developers mentally categorize different types of operations.
  Event management stands out as a distinct concern from the surrounding code.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When event operations are clearly separated, it is easier to modify or refactor event-related code without accidentally affecting other logic.
  Developers can make changes to event handling with confidence.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after event registration and un-registration statements.
Ensure that event operations are visually separated from surrounding code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6049
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6049
```
