# MiKo_1518: Do not prefix or suffix local variables with `reference`

## Cause

A local variable name contains `reference` as a prefix or suffix.

## Rule description

Reference types in .NET are already references, so adding `Reference` to variable names is redundant.
Use names that describe the object's role, not its implementation detail.

Using clear, role-based names instead of implementation details improves code readability and maintainability.

### Rationale behind

In .NET, all class instances are reference types by default.
Adding `reference` to variable names is redundant and adds noise without providing any useful semantic information.

Using role-based naming provides several important benefits:

- **Elimination of Redundancy**:
  In .NET, saying `userReference` is like saying `user reference reference` because class instances are already references.
  Simply using `user` is clearer and more concise.

- **Focus on Business Logic**:
  Variable names should describe what role the object plays in your business logic, not low-level implementation details.
  `customer` tells you about the domain, `customerReference` tells you about memory management.

- **Reduced Visual Noise**:
  The suffix `Reference` makes variable names longer without adding meaning.
  Shorter, clearer names improve code readability and reduce line wrapping.

- **Consistency with .NET Conventions**:
  The .NET Framework and standard C# code do not use `reference` in variable names.
  Following this convention makes your code feel more professional and familiar.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  If you change how an object is stored or passed (though this is rare in .NET), role-based names remain valid.
  Names with `reference` would need updating if implementation details change.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  Developers should not need to think about memory management details when reading business logic.
  Clear role names keep the focus on what the code does, not how memory is managed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the local variable to remove `reference` from its name and use a name that describes its role.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1518
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1518
```
