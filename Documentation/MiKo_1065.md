# MiKo_1065: Follow .NET Framework Design Guidelines for operator overload parameter names

## Cause

An operator overload parameter does not follow the standard naming convention.

## Rule description

According to the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for operator overloads, parameters should have standard names if they do not have specific meanings.
- For binary operator overloads, use `left` and `right`.
- For unary operator overloads, use `value`.

This ensures clarity and consistency in the code.

### Rationale behind

Operator overloads are special methods that define how operators work with custom types.
Following standard naming conventions helps developers immediately understand which operand is which.
The .NET Framework Design Guidelines establish these conventions to ensure consistency across all .NET code.

Following standard operator parameter names provides several important benefits:

- **Consistency with .NET Framework**:
  Using `left`, `right`, and `value` matches the conventions used throughout the .NET ecosystem.
  This makes the code feel familiar to any .NET developer.

- **Immediate Understanding**:
  Developers know that `left` is the first operand and `right` is the second operand.
  No mental effort is required to figure out the parameter order.

- **Better Documentation**:
  When documentation or examples refer to operator overloads, they typically use these standard names.
  Using the same names makes it easier to relate code to documentation.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Non-standard names like `a`, `b`, `first`, `second`, or `x`, `y` require developers to think about what each parameter represents.
  Standard names eliminate this confusion.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Following established guidelines demonstrates awareness of .NET best practices.
  It shows attention to code quality and maintainability.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the operator parameters to follow the standard naming conventions.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1065
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1065
```
