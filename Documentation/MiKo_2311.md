# MiKo_2311: Do not use separator comments

## Cause

A comment is being used as a visual separator or divider in the code.

## Rule description

Comments should provide insight into the rationale behind the code, explaining why it is written that way.
Using comments to separate code is not their intended purpose.
Instead, comments should enhance understanding, giving context and reasoning for better comprehension and maintainability and keeping everything focused and informative.

### Rationale behind

Separator comments are lines of dashes, equals signs, or other characters used to visually divide sections of code.
They serve no informational purpose and can actually make code harder to read by adding visual clutter.

Avoiding separator comments provides several important benefits:

- **Reduces Visual Clutter**:
  Separator lines take up space without providing information.
  Removing them makes code cleaner and easier to read.

- **Encourages Better Structure**:
  Instead of using separators, code should be organized into well-named methods or classes.
  This provides better separation through logical structure rather than visual tricks.

- **Improves Maintainability**:
  When code is separated by separators, developers must maintain these visual elements.
  Proper code organization eliminates this unnecessary maintenance burden.

- **Focuses Comments on Value**:
  Comments should explain why code exists, not just visually separate it.
  Eliminating separators encourages developers to write meaningful comments.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  Code analysis and documentation tools do not benefit from separator comments.
  They can even interfere with automated processing.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Modern code should rely on proper structure and organization rather than ASCII art separators.
  This demonstrates better software engineering practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove separator comments.
If sections of code need to be separated, consider extracting them into separate methods with descriptive names instead.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2311
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2311
```
