# MiKo_3001: Do not use custom delegates

## Cause

A custom delegate type is declared instead of using a pre-defined .NET delegate type.

## Rule description

To ease maintenance, use the pre-defined .NET Framework delegate types such as `Action`, `Func` or `Expression` instead of custom delegates.

### Rationale behind

Custom delegates introduce unnecessary complexity and reduce code maintainability.
The [.NET Framework already provides generic delegate types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/events-and-callbacks) that cover virtually all common scenarios.

Using pre-defined delegate types provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  Standard delegate types are familiar to all .NET developers.
  This makes the code easier to understand for everyone working with it.

- **Better Interoperability**:
  Many .NET APIs and libraries expect standard delegate types.
  Using them ensures seamless integration with existing frameworks.

- **Reduced Code Complexity**:
  Pre-defined delegates eliminate the need to declare and maintain custom delegate types.
  This keeps the codebase simpler and cleaner.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  `Action` and `Func` clearly communicate the delegate's purpose without requiring developers to look up custom type definitions.
  The intent is immediately clear from the method signature.

- **Easier Refactoring**:
  Standard delegates are widely supported by IDE refactoring tools.
  Changes to method signatures using standard delegates are handled automatically.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the custom delegate with an appropriate pre-defined delegate type such as `Action`, `Func`, or `Expression`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3001
```
