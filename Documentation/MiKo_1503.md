# MiKo_1503: Do not suffix methods with `Counter`

## Cause

A method name ends with `Counter`.

## Rule description

Methods that return values but are suffixed with `Counter` are most likely not returning counters but counted values instead.
So they should be suffixed with `Count`.

Using precise naming helps developers understand what the method returns and improves code clarity.

### Rationale behind

The distinction between `Counter` and `Count` is important for semantic clarity and consistency with established .NET naming conventions.
A `Counter` typically refers to an object or mechanism that performs counting, while `Count` refers to the numeric result of counting.

Using the correct suffix provides several important benefits:

- **Semantic Accuracy**:
  `Count` clearly indicates that the method returns a numeric value representing how many items exist.
  `Counter` incorrectly suggests the method returns a counting mechanism or object.

- **Consistency with .NET Framework**:
  The .NET Framework consistently uses `Count` for properties and methods that return numeric values (e.g., `List.Count`, `Array.Length`).
  Following this pattern makes your code feel more natural to .NET developers.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Developers immediately understand that `GetUserCount()` returns an integer, while `GetUserCounter()` might make them wonder if it returns a `Counter` object.
  This eliminates mental overhead and potential mistakes.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  When developers type `Count`, they will see all count-related methods grouped together, making discovery easier.
  Mixing `Counter` with `Count` breaks this logical grouping.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to replace `Counter` with `Count`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1503
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1503
```
