# MiKo_1409: Do not prefix or suffix namespaces with underscores

## Cause

A namespace contains leading or trailing underscores in its name.

## Rule description

Namespaces should be made up of full words without any leading or trailing underscores.
This helps developers easily understand and navigate the code structure.

### Rationale behind

Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups.
Having underscores at the beginning or end of namespace names does not add any value and goes against common naming conventions.

Clear and properly formatted namespace names provide several important benefits:

- **Better Readability**:
  Namespace names without underscores are easier to read at a glance.
  Developers can quickly understand the structure and purpose of the namespace.

- **Consistent with .NET Guidelines**:
  The .NET Framework Design Guidelines recommend using PascalCase for namespaces without underscores.
  Following these guidelines ensures consistency across your codebase and aligns with common .NET practices.

- **Improved Navigation**:
  Well-named namespaces make it easier to locate and work with related types.
  This organization helps developers find what they need quickly.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Code that follows standard naming conventions looks more professional and is easier to work with.
  This makes collaboration and code reviews more effective.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove any leading or trailing underscores from the namespace name.

For example, change `namespace _MyNamespace` to `namespace MyNamespace` or `namespace MyNamespace_` to `namespace MyNamespace`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1409
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1409
```
