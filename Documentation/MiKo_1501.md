# MiKo_1501: Do not use `Filter` in names

## Cause

A name contains the term `Filter`.

## Rule description

When naming something `Filter`, it is not clear whether the criteria to filter on gets included or excluded in the result.
So instead, it should be named something like `IncludeBy`, `ExcludeBy`, `Remove`, `Skip` or `Take`.
That makes it clear about what gets filtered.

Using clear and specific names improves code readability and helps developers quickly understand the intent and behavior of the code.

### Rationale behind

Ambiguous method names like `Filter` create confusion and require developers to read the implementation or documentation to understand the actual behavior.
This slows down development and increases the likelihood of bugs when assumptions are made about what gets filtered.

Using explicit names provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Intent**:
  Names like `IncludeBy` or `ExcludeBy` immediately communicate whether items matching the criteria are kept or removed from the result.
  Developers do not need to guess or look up the implementation.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When reading code, developers can quickly understand the data flow without having to mentally track what `Filter` means in each specific context.
  This makes the code easier to scan and comprehend.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Future developers can modify and extend the code with confidence, knowing exactly what operation is being performed.
  This reduces the risk of introducing bugs during maintenance.

- **Improved Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly understand the logic without having to ask for clarification or study the implementation in detail.
  This speeds up the review process and catches potential issues earlier.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the element to use a more specific term like `IncludeBy`, `ExcludeBy`, `Remove`, `Skip` or `Take` instead of `Filter`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1501
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1501
```
