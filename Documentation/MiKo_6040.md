# MiKo_6040: Align consecutive multi-line invocations by their dots

## Cause

Consecutive method invocations spanning multiple lines are not vertically aligned by their dots.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when consecutive invocations spanning multiple lines are vertically aligned by their dots.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Method chaining and fluent APIs are common patterns in modern C# code, especially with LINQ and builder patterns.
When consecutive invocations are not aligned, the code becomes visually cluttered and the flow of operations is harder to follow.

Aligning consecutive multi-line invocations by their dots provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Visual Structure**:
  Vertical alignment creates a clear visual column that makes it easy to see the sequence of method calls.
  Developers can quickly scan down the aligned dots to understand the chain of operations.

- **Easier Code Comprehension**:
  Aligned method chains read like a list of sequential operations.
  This makes it easier to understand what the code does step by step without having to parse irregular indentation.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  When dots are aligned, developers can quickly identify all methods in a chain by following the vertical line of dots.
  This makes it easier to spot which methods are being called and in what order.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Consistent alignment reduces the mental effort needed to parse the code structure.
  Developers do not need to mentally reconstruct the method chain from inconsistent indentation.

- **Clearer Separation of Concerns**:
  Each aligned method call stands out as a distinct step in the operation.
  This helps developers understand the individual transformations or operations being performed.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  When method chains are consistently aligned, it is easier to add, remove, or modify steps in the chain.
  Developers can make changes without disrupting the visual structure of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, align the dots of consecutive multi-line method invocations vertically.
Ensure that all dots in a method chain are positioned at the same column position.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6040
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6040
```
