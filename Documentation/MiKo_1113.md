# MiKo_1113: Do not use BDD style naming for test methods

## Cause

A test method uses BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style naming like `Given_When_Then`.

## Rule description

While BDD style naming (`Given_When_Then`) has its place, it is not the preferred naming convention for unit tests.
Use more direct and fluent naming instead.

### Rationale behind

Avoiding BDD-style naming in favor of more direct naming is important for test clarity and simplicity.

Using direct and fluent naming instead of `Given_When_Then` provides several important benefits:

- **Reduced Verbosity**:
  Direct naming eliminates the structural overhead of `Given_When_Then`, making test names shorter and easier to scan.
  `Save_returns_success_for_valid_user` is more concise than `Given_valid_user_When_saving_Then_returns_success`.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Fluent test names read like natural sentences without requiring developers to mentally parse the `Given_When_Then` structure.
  This reduces cognitive load when reading test suites.

- **Clearer Focus**:
  Direct naming puts the action and outcome first, immediately communicating what the test validates.
  With BDD-style names, the important information is often buried in the middle or end.

- **Better Test Reports**:
  Shorter, more direct test names fit better in test runner output and continuous integration reports, making failed tests easier to identify at a glance.

- **Reduced Naming Conflicts**:
  BDD-style naming can lead to awkwardly long names when dealing with complex scenarios.
  Direct naming provides more flexibility to describe tests clearly without rigid structure constraints.

- **Alignment with Code Style**:
  Most .NET projects use direct, fluent naming for test methods, so following this convention makes codebases more consistent with community practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test method to use a more direct and fluent naming style.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1113
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1113
```
