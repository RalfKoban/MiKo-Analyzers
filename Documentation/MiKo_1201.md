# MiKo_1201: Name exception parameters consistently

## Cause

An exception parameter is not named consistently.

## Rule description

Exception parameters in method signatures (especially for constructors or exception-handling methods) should be named consistently, typically `innerException` for inner exceptions or `exception` for general exception parameters.

### Rationale behind

Consistent naming of exception parameters is essential for maintaining a professional and predictable API surface.
Using standard names like `innerException` aligns with .NET Framework conventions, making the code feel natural to other .NET developers.

This consistency provides several important benefits:

- **Alignment with .NET Conventions**:
  Standard names like `innerException` match the conventions used throughout the .NET Framework.
  This makes the code feel natural and professional to other .NET developers.

- **Improved Code Comprehension**:
  Developers understand method signatures at a glance without needing to consult documentation.
  The purpose of each parameter is immediately clear.

- **Reduced Error Probability**:
  When exception parameters follow established patterns, it is easier to correctly pass exceptions through call chains.
  This reduces the likelihood of errors where the wrong parameter is passed to a base constructor or method.

- **Better IDE Support**:
  IntelliSense and code completion work more effectively when parameter names follow expected conventions.
  This improves developer productivity during exception wrapping or rethrowing operations.

- **Consistent Exception Handling**:
  Standardized parameter names make exception handling patterns more recognizable across the codebase.
  This makes it easier to understand and maintain exception propagation logic.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the exception parameter to use a consistent name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1201
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1201
```
