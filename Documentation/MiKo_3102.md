# MiKo_3102: Do not use conditional statements in test methods

## Cause

A test method contains conditional statements such as `if`, `switch`, or ternary operators.

## Rule description

Tests should focus on a specific scenario.
Including a condition in a test means it is testing more than one scenario, which is a code smell.
Keep tests simple and specific to ensure clarity and maintainability.

### Rationale behind

Tests with conditional logic are inherently more complex and harder to understand than straightforward tests.
When a test contains conditions, it is actually testing multiple scenarios within a single test method, which violates the principle of testing one thing at a time.

This rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Test Clarity**:
  Tests without conditional logic are easier to read and understand.
  Each test clearly shows what scenario is being verified without requiring developers to trace through different execution paths.

- **Better Failure Diagnosis**:
  When a simple test fails, the cause is immediately obvious.
  Conditional logic can mask which specific scenario caused the failure, making debugging more difficult.

- **Reduced Test Complexity**:
  Removing conditional statements from tests makes them simpler and less prone to bugs.
  The test code itself becomes more reliable and easier to maintain.

- **Clearer Test Intent**:
  Each test method should verify a single behavior or scenario.
  Splitting conditional tests into separate test methods makes the intent of each test explicit.

- **Easier Test Maintenance**:
  Simple tests without conditions are easier to update when requirements change.
  There is no need to analyze complex branching logic to understand what the test does.

- **More Comprehensive Coverage**:
  Splitting conditional tests into multiple tests often reveals edge cases that were not adequately covered.
  Each scenario gets its own dedicated test with appropriate assertions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, split the test method into separate test methods, one for each scenario being tested.

## How to suppress violations

#pragma warning disable MiKo_3102
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3102
