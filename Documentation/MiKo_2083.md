# MiKo_2083: Do not falsely document writable fields as read-only

## Cause

A writable field is documented as being read-only.

## Rule description

Writable fields should not mention being read-only since they are not.
This keeps things clear and straightforward for developers.

### Rationale behind

Documenting a writable field as read-only is factually incorrect and will mislead developers who rely on the documentation.
When documentation contradicts the actual code, it creates confusion and can lead to bugs.

Developers reading the documentation might assume they cannot modify a field when in fact they can, or they might question whether the code or the documentation is correct.
This ambiguity wastes time and reduces trust in the documentation.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Accurate Information**:
  Documentation that matches the actual code ensures developers have correct information about how to use the field.

- **Prevented Confusion**:
  Avoiding contradictory documentation eliminates uncertainty about field behavior.

- **Maintained Trust**:
  Accurate documentation builds developer confidence in the codebase and its documentation.

- **Reduced Debugging Time**:
  When documentation is correct, developers do not waste time investigating discrepancies between code and comments.

- **Better Code Quality**:
  Attention to documentation accuracy reflects overall code quality and professionalism.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the incorrect read-only indication from the field documentation.
Update the documentation to accurately describe the field's actual mutability.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2083
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2083
```
