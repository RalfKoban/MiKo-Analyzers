# MiKo_3220: Simplify logical `&&` or `||` conditions using `true` or `false`

## Cause

A logical condition contains a direct comparison with `true` or `false`.

## Rule description

Simplify logical `&&` or `||` conditions by removing direct uses of `true` or `false`.
This makes your code cleaner and easier to read.

### Rationale behind

Comparing boolean values directly with `true` or `false` adds unnecessary verbosity to the code.
Boolean expressions already evaluate to `true` or `false`, so explicit comparisons are redundant.

Simplifying boolean conditions provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Code without redundant boolean comparisons is more concise and easier to understand at a glance.
  Developers can quickly grasp the logic without parsing unnecessary syntax.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Removing redundant comparisons reduces cognitive load when reading conditional statements.
  The code's intent becomes immediately clear.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Simpler expressions are easier to modify and less prone to errors during updates.
  There are fewer parts that can be accidentally broken.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Direct use of boolean expressions communicates intent more clearly than explicit comparisons.
  The code reads more naturally and follows common conventions.

- **Consistency with Best Practices**:
  Most coding standards discourage redundant boolean comparisons.
  Following this rule aligns with widely accepted best practices.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the explicit comparison with `true` or `false`.
Use the boolean expression directly in `&&` or `||` conditions.
For comparisons with `false`, use the logical NOT operator (`!`) instead.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3220
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3220
```
