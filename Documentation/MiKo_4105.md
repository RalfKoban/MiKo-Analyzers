# MiKo_4105: Place object under test fields before all other fields

## Cause

The field that contains the object under test is not placed before all other fields.

## Rule description

The field that contains the object under test is an essential part of a test class.
To make them easy to find, place these fields first.

### Rationale behind

The object under test represents the primary focus of the test class and is the most important field in any test.

All other fields typically exist to support testing this object, so placing it first emphasizes its central role and makes the test's purpose immediately clear.

Placing object under test fields before all other fields provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Test Focus**:
  When the object under test appears first, developers can instantly identify what is being tested.
  This provides essential context before reading any test methods or other fields.

- **Clear Test Purpose**:
  Prominent placement of the object under test makes the test class's intent obvious.
  There is no ambiguity about what the tests are verifying.

- **Better Test Understanding**:
  Seeing the object under test first helps developers understand the context for all other fields.
  Supporting fields make more sense when the main object is already known.

- **Easier Test Maintenance**:
  When modifying tests, developers need to reference the object under test frequently.
  Having it in a predictable location at the top saves time and reduces scrolling.

- **Improved Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly identify what is being tested and verify that tests are focused on the correct object.
  The prominent placement makes this verification immediate.

- **Consistent Test Structure**:
  A standard pattern where the object under test always comes first makes all test classes easier to navigate.
  Developers know exactly where to look across the entire test suite.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the field that contains the object under test to the beginning of the field declarations.

It should appear before all other fields in the test class.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4105
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4105
```
