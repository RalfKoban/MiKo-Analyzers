# MiKo_3025: Do not re-assign method parameters

## Cause

A method parameter is re-assigned to a different value within the method body.

## Rule description

Treat method parameters as read-only.
Avoid re-assigning them to other values.
If another value is needed, use a local variable instead.
This approach keeps the method clean and predictable.

### Rationale behind

Re-assigning parameters makes code harder to understand and debug.
When parameters change values during method execution, tracking the flow of data becomes more difficult.

Treating parameters as read-only provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  When parameters do not change, developers can reason about method behavior more easily.
  The parameter's value throughout the method matches what was passed in.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  During debugging, parameter values remain constant.
  This makes it simpler to understand the method's inputs and trace execution.

- **Clearer Data Flow**:
  Using separate variables for modified values makes transformations explicit.
  Developers can see exactly how data flows through the method.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Re-assigned parameters can be mistaken for the original values.
  Keeping them unchanged prevents this source of confusion.

- **Better Code Maintainability**:
  Methods with immutable parameters are easier to refactor.
  Changes to the logic do not need to account for modified parameter values.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, introduce a local variable to hold the modified value instead of re-assigning the parameter.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3025
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3025
```
