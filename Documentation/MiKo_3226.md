# MiKo_3226: Make read-only fields with initializers const

## Cause

A read-only field has a pre-assigned constant value but is not declared as `const`.

## Rule description

Read-only fields with pre-assigned values are likely meant to be constant values.
Therefore, make these fields `const`.
This ensures their values remain constant and clearly communicates their intended use.

### Rationale behind

Fields marked as `readonly` can be assigned in constructors, which suggests they might vary between instances.
However, when a read-only field has a compile-time constant value, it should be declared as `const` to communicate that the value never changes.

Making constant fields `const` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Performance**:
  Constant fields are inlined by the compiler, which can improve performance.
  The values are embedded directly in the code that uses them, eliminating field access overhead.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `const` keyword explicitly communicates that the value is a compile-time constant.
  Developers immediately understand that the value never changes.

- **Better Optimization**:
  Compilers can optimize constant values more aggressively than read-only fields.
  This can lead to faster and more efficient code.

- **Reduced Memory Usage**:
  Constant fields do not require storage in each instance.
  They exist only in the type metadata, reducing memory overhead.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Using `const` prevents accidental modifications in constructors.
  The compiler enforces the constancy of the value.

- **Consistency**:
  Using the appropriate keyword for constant values follows .NET best practices.
  This makes the codebase more consistent and easier to understand.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the field declaration from `readonly` to `const`.
Ensure the field's value is a compile-time constant compatible with the `const` modifier.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3226
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3226
```
