# MiKo_1034: Do not suffix entity fields with `Model`

## Cause

A field name ends with the suffix `Model` when it represents an entity.

## Rule description

Using `Model` as a suffix for field names is unnecessary.
Just name the field plainly, like `user` instead of `userModel`.
This keeps it simple and clear.

Field names should describe what they store, not include implementation details or design pattern names.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing field names with `Model` creates unnecessary verbosity that clutters the code.
The field's type declaration already indicates what kind of object it holds, so adding `Model` to the name duplicates information without providing value.

Clean, concise field names make classes easier to read and understand.
When fields are named after what they represent rather than technical classifications, the code becomes more intuitive and aligns better with domain concepts.

Removing `Model` from field names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter field names make class definitions and code easier to scan.
  `private User _user;` is clearer than `private User _userModel;`.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The field type already shows it is a User entity.
  Adding `Model` to the name repeats this information unnecessarily.

- **More Natural Code**:
  Throughout the class, using `_user.Name` reads more naturally than `_userModel.Name`.
  The code flows better when field names are simple and direct.

- **Consistency with Conventions**:
  Standard C# naming conventions favor simple, descriptive names for fields.
  Following this convention makes code more familiar and easier for other developers to work with.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  If architectural changes mean entities are no longer called "models", field names do not need updating.
  Names focused on domain concepts remain stable over time.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Field names should describe what data they hold, not technical implementation details.
  `_user` clearly indicates this field stores user information, without unnecessary technical noise.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field to remove the `Model` suffix, using a simple name that describes what the field stores.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1034
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1034
```
