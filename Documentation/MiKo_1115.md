# MiKo_1115: Name test methods in a fluent way

## Cause

A test method name is not fluent or readable.

## Rule description

Test method names should read like natural sentences that clearly describe what is being tested.
They should be fluent and easy to understand at a glance.

Avoid "Yoda-speak" style names where the condition comes before the action, which makes them harder to read.
A fluent name puts the action first and reads naturally from left to right.

### Rationale behind

Using fluent naming for test methods is important for test readability and maintainability.

Writing test names that read like natural sentences provides several important benefits:

- **Natural Reading Flow**:
  Fluent names read from left to right in a logical order: action - condition - outcome.
  This matches how we naturally think and speak, making test names instantly understandable.
  "Yoda-style" names reverse this order, forcing developers to mentally rearrange the information.

- **Immediate Comprehension**:
  Fluent names allow developers to understand what a test validates without reading the implementation.
  This saves time and makes test suites more accessible.
  Names like `Send_sends_email_to_valid_address` or `Calculate_throws_ArgumentOutOfRangeException_for_negative_input` immediately tell you what happens, while `Send_EMailAddressValid_SendsMail` or `Calculate_InputNegative_ThrowsArgumentOutOfRangeException` require mental parsing.

- **Better Living Documentation**:
  Tests with fluent names serve as executable documentation that clearly describes how the system should behave in different scenarios.
  This documentation is always up-to-date because it is the actual test code.

- **Improved Test Reports**:
  When tests fail in continuous integration or test runners, fluent names make failure reports read like plain English, making it immediately clear what went wrong.
  `Send sends email to valid address: FAILED` is clearer than `Send EMailAddressValid SendsMail: FAILED`.

- **Easier Test Maintenance**:
  Well-named tests are easier to maintain because their purpose is obvious.
  Developers can quickly determine if a test is still relevant or needs updating.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Fluent naming reduces the mental effort needed to understand test suites, making code reviews faster and more effective.
  Natural sentence structure is easier to process than awkward constructions.

- **More Professional Codebase**:
  Clear, well-written test names demonstrate attention to quality and make the entire project feel more polished and professional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test method to read more naturally, with a logical flow from action to condition to outcome.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1115
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1115
```
