# MiKo_3053: Register `DependencyPropertyKey` fields properly

## Cause

A `DependencyPropertyKey` field is not registered correctly using `DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly()` and the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

To prevent typos, register fields that are the key of a `DependencyProperty` using `DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly()` and the `nameof` operator.
Also, ensure the correct property names, property types, and owning types are provided.

### Rationale behind

Read-only dependency properties require correct registration to function properly in the WPF property system.
The registration creates the connection between the property key, metadata, and the property itself.

Properly registering dependency property keys provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Verification**:
  Using `nameof` ensures the compiler validates that the property name is correct.
  String literals can contain typos that cause runtime failures when the property system cannot find the property.

- **Refactoring Safety**:
  When properties are renamed, `nameof` expressions are automatically updated by refactoring tools.
  String literals in registration remain unchanged, causing property system failures.

- **Type Safety**:
  Correct property type specification ensures value validation works properly.
  Wrong types can allow invalid values to be set or cause type conversion errors.

- **Owner Type Correctness**:
  Specifying the correct owner ensures the property is registered in the right class hierarchy.
  Incorrect owners can cause property inheritance and override issues.

- **Read-Only Enforcement**:
  Using `RegisterReadOnly` creates the key necessary to control write access.
  Incorrect registration might create a fully writable property instead of a read-only one.

- **Metadata Integrity**:
  Proper registration establishes default values and property change callbacks.
  Registration errors can cause the property to behave incorrectly or inconsistently.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure the registration call uses `DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly()` with correct parameters.
Use `nameof` for the property name, specify the correct property type and owning type.
Store the result in a non-public `DependencyPropertyKey` field.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3053
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3053
```
