# MiKo_1513: Do not suffix types with `Advanced`, `Complex`, `Enhanced`, `Extended`, `Simple` or `Simplified`

## Cause

A type name is suffixed with `Advanced`, `Complex`, `Enhanced`, `Extended`, `Simple` or `Simplified`.

## Rule description

Prefer prefixing type names with descriptive modifiers like `Advanced` or `Simplified` instead of suffixing them.
Prefixes improve IntelliSense grouping and readability, while also making related types easier to discover and maintain across large codebases.

Using prefixes instead of suffixes helps keep related types grouped together and makes navigation easier.

### Rationale behind

The placement of descriptive modifiers in type names significantly affects how developers discover and work with related types.
Suffixes scatter related types alphabetically, while prefixes keep them grouped together.

Using prefixes instead of suffixes provides several important benefits:

- **Better IntelliSense Grouping**:
  When you type `Simple` in IntelliSense, you see all simplified versions together: `SimpleCalculator`, `SimpleValidator`, `SimpleFormatter`.
  With suffixes, they would be scattered: `CalculatorSimple`, `ValidatorSimple`, `FormatterSimple` appear in different places.

- **Easier Type Discovery**:
  Developers looking for a simplified version of a component can type the complexity level first and see all options.
  This is much faster than scrolling through alphabetically sorted types to find suffixed versions.

- **Natural Reading Order**:
  English typically places modifiers before nouns: 'simple calculator` not `calculator simple`.
  Prefixes match this natural reading pattern, making type names feel more intuitive.

- **Consistent with Framework Patterns**:
  The .NET Framework often uses prefixes for variants, such as `Async` methods or `I` for interfaces.
  Following this pattern makes your code feel more consistent with the ecosystem.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Related types appearing together in file explorers and class views helps developers understand the relationships and variants available in the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to move the suffix to a prefix position.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1513
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1513
```
