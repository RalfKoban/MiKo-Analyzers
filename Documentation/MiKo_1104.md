# MiKo_1104: Name test cleanup methods `CleanupTest`

## Cause

A test teardown method is not named `CleanupTest`.

## Rule description

Test teardown methods (marked with `[TearDown]` or similar attributes) should be consistently named `CleanupTest` to clearly indicate their purpose and improve readability.

### Rationale behind

Using a consistent name for test teardown methods is important for test code readability and maintainability.

Naming all test teardown methods `CleanupTest` provides several important benefits:

- **Immediate Recognition**:
  Developers can instantly recognize teardown methods across all test classes without having to check attributes or read method bodies.
  This standardization reduces cognitive load when navigating test code.

- **Consistent Team Standards**:
  A uniform naming convention ensures all team members follow the same pattern, making code reviews easier and reducing debates about naming choices.

- **Clearer Purpose**:
  The name `CleanupTest` clearly communicates that this method cleans up resources after each test completes.
  This is more explicit than generic names like `Teardown` or `Cleanup`.

- **Symmetry with Setup**:
  Using `CleanupTest` pairs naturally with `PrepareTest`, creating a clear symmetry that makes the test lifecycle easier to understand.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all teardown methods have the same name, it is easier to find and modify cleanup logic across multiple test classes.
  This consistency speeds up maintenance tasks.

- **Better Resource Management**:
  Clear, consistent naming helps ensure that cleanup code is not overlooked, reducing the risk of resource leaks in test suites.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the test teardown method to `CleanupTest`.
