# MiKo_2206: Do not use term `flag` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses the term `flag` when referring to boolean values.

## Rule description

Documentation should avoid using the term `flag` for boolean values.
Instead, rephrase the documentation to eliminate the need for this term.
This ensures clarity and precision, making it easier for developers to understand the context and purpose of the boolean value.

### Rationale behind

The term `flag` is jargon that originates from low-level programming where individual bits are used to represent boolean states.
While experienced developers understand this term, it is not the most clear or descriptive way to document boolean values.

Modern documentation should describe what the boolean value represents rather than labeling it as a `flag`.
This makes the purpose and meaning of the value immediately clear without requiring familiarity with programming jargon.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Describing what a boolean represents is more informative than calling it a `flag`.

- **Better Accessibility**:
  Avoiding jargon makes documentation easier to understand for less experienced developers.

- **More Descriptive Documentation**:
  Explaining the boolean's purpose provides more value than simply labeling its type.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Documentation that describes the boolean's meaning communicates the developer's intent more effectively.

- **Professional Style**:
  Modern technical writing favors descriptive language over technical jargon when possible.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rephrase the documentation to describe what the boolean value indicates or controls without using the word `flag`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2206
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2206
```
