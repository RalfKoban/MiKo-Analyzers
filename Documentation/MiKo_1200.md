# MiKo_1200: Name catch block exceptions consistently

## Cause

An exception variable in a catch block is not named consistently.

## Rule description

Exception variables in catch blocks should be named consistently, typically `ex` or `exception`, to make code easier to read and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Consistent naming of exception variables across a codebase is vital for readability and team collaboration.
When all developers use the same convention (such as `ex`) for exception variables, it creates predictability.
Anyone reading the code knows exactly what to expect when they see a catch block.

This consistency provides several important benefits:

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Developers do not need to decipher different variable names for the same purpose.
  They can focus on understanding the exception handling logic rather than parsing variable names.

- **Improved Code Reviews**:
  Consistent naming makes it easier to spot issues in error handling patterns.
  Reviewers can quickly scan catch blocks without being distracted by inconsistent naming.

- **Better Searchability**:
  Finding all exception handling code becomes straightforward when variables are named consistently.
  This is especially useful when investigating error handling strategies or debugging production issues.

- **Enhanced Predictability**:
  Anyone reading the code knows exactly what to expect when they see a catch block.
  This creates a familiar pattern across the entire codebase.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When exception handling needs to be updated or refactored, consistent naming makes it easier to identify and modify all relevant code.
  The standardized pattern reduces the risk of overlooking important exception handling logic.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the exception variable to use a consistent name like `ex`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1200
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1200
```
