# MiKo_2234: Use `to` instead of `that is to` or `which is to` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains wordy phrases like "that is to" or "which is to" instead of the simpler "to".

## Rule description

Phrases like "that is to" or "which is to" are wordy and can just be replaced with "to".
This makes documentation clearer and more concise for developers.

### Rationale behind

Wordy phrases make documentation longer without adding any additional meaning.
Simpler, more direct language communicates the same information more efficiently and improves the reading experience.

Using "to" instead of wordy alternatives provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Replacing three or four words with a single word makes documentation more concise.
  Readers can absorb information faster when it is presented efficiently.

- **Enhanced Clarity**:
  Simpler language is easier to understand, especially for non-native English speakers.
  Removing unnecessary words reduces complexity.

- **Faster Reading**:
  Concise documentation can be read and understood more quickly.
  Developers spend less time reading and more time coding.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Clear, concise writing demonstrates professionalism and attention to quality.
  Wordy documentation appears less polished.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Every unnecessary word adds a small amount of cognitive load for readers.
  Eliminating wordiness makes documentation easier to process.

- **Better Focus**:
  When documentation is concise, the important information stands out more clearly.
  Wordy phrases dilute the key messages.
