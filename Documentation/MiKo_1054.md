# MiKo_1054: Do not name types `Helper` or `Utility`

## Cause

A type name contains `Helper`, `Util`, or `Misc`.

## Rule description

Names like `Helper` or `Utility` are too vague and do not follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
These types often end up having too broad a scope and do not clearly define what they do.

Instead, use specific names that describe their exact purpose, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Type names like `Helper`, `Utility`, `Util`, or `Misc` are vague and provide no information about what the type actually does.
These names often become dumping grounds for unrelated methods that do not belong together.

When a class is named with such generic terms, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle because the class lacks a clear, focused purpose.
Over time, these classes tend to grow larger and more difficult to maintain.

Using specific, descriptive type names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Specific names like `StringFormatter`, `DataValidator`, or `FileParser` immediately communicate what the type does.
  Developers can understand the purpose of the class without having to read its implementation.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  When types have clear, specific names, it becomes easier to organize code logically.
  Related functionality naturally groups together in appropriately named types.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  When developers need specific functionality, descriptive type names make it easier to find the right class.
  This reduces time spent searching through the codebase.

- **Stronger Single Responsibility Principle**:
  A specific name encourages developers to keep the type focused on one responsibility.
  This leads to smaller, more maintainable classes that are easier to test and modify.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Descriptive names make the design intent explicit.
  Other developers can understand what the type is meant to do and where new functionality should be added.

- **Reduced Code Smell**:
  Vague names like `Helper` or `Utility` are often code smells indicating poor design.
  Using specific names encourages better architectural decisions.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to reflect its specific purpose.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1054
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1054
