# MiKo_1035: Do not use `Model` marker in properties dealing with entities

## Cause

A property name includes `Model` when dealing with entity types.

## Rule description

Using `Model` in a property name to show it deals with an entity is unnecessary.
Just name the property clearly without `Model`.

Property names should directly represent what they expose, not include design pattern terminology or implementation details.

### Rationale behind

Including `Model` in property names creates unnecessary verbosity that makes code harder to read.
The property's type already indicates what kind of object it exposes, so adding `Model` to the name duplicates information without adding value.

Clean, concise property names improve code readability and make classes easier to understand.
When properties are named after what they represent rather than technical classifications, the code becomes more natural and aligns better with domain concepts.

Removing `Model` from property names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter property names make code easier to scan and understand.
  `CurrentUser` is clearer than `CurrentUserModel`

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The property type already shows it is a User entity.
  Adding `Model` to the name repeats this information unnecessarily.

- **More Natural Code**:
  Using `CurrentUser.Name` reads more naturally than `CurrentUserModel.Name`.
  The code flows better when property names are simple and direct.

- **Consistency with Conventions**:
  Standard C# naming conventions favor simple, descriptive names for properties.
  Following this convention makes code more familiar to other developers.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  If architectural changes mean entities are no longer called "models", property names do not need updating.
  Names focused on domain concepts remain stable over time.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Property names should describe what data they expose, not technical implementation details.
  `CurrentUser` clearly indicates what the property represents, without unnecessary technical noise.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Clean, direct property names signal well-designed, thoughtful code.
  They make the codebase feel more polished and easier to work with.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the property to remove the `Model` marker, using a name that describes what the property represents.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1035
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1035
```
