# MiKo_4001: Order methods with same name based on their parameter count

## Cause

Methods with the same name are not ordered by their parameter count.

## Rule description

Order methods with the same name but different parameters so that those with fewer parameters come first.
This shows all overloads in logical order and improves readability, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Ordering method overloads by parameter count creates a predictable and intuitive structure that makes code easier to navigate and understand.

When overloads are arranged from simplest (fewest parameters) to most complex (most parameters), it allows developers to quickly grasp the progression of functionality and select the appropriate method for their needs.

Consistent ordering of method overloads provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  When overloads are ordered consistently, developers can quickly scan the list to find the version that matches their needs.
  The progression from simple to complex becomes immediately apparent.

- **Better Understanding of Intent**:
  Ordering from fewest to most parameters naturally shows how simpler overloads often delegate to more complex ones.
  This reveals the relationship between different versions of the method and makes the design pattern clearer.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When all overloads are grouped in a predictable order, it is easier to spot missing overloads or inconsistencies in the API design.
  Adding new overloads becomes straightforward as there is a clear place where they belong.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Consistent ordering means developers do not need to search randomly through the code to find related overloads.
  The predictable structure reduces mental effort and makes the codebase easier to work with.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  A logical progression from simple to complex makes the code read more naturally.
  It follows the principle of presenting information in order of increasing complexity.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that all overloads follow the same pattern and are properly ordered.
  Deviations from the expected order become immediately obvious.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reorder the methods so that overloads with fewer parameters appear before those with more parameters.

Keep all overloads with the same name grouped together, arranged in ascending order based on their parameter count.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4001
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4001
```
