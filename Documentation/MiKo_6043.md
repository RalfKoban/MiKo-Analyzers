# MiKo_6043: Place expression bodies of lambdas on same line as lambda when fitting

## Cause

Lambda expression bodies that could fit on a single line are split across multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when lambdas with expression bodies are placed on a single line.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Lambda expressions are widely used in modern C# code, particularly with LINQ and functional programming patterns.
When short lambda expressions are unnecessarily split across multiple lines, the code becomes more verbose and harder to read.

Placing expression bodies on the same line as the lambda when they fit provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Short lambda expressions that fit on one line are easier to read and understand at a glance.
  Developers can quickly grasp what the lambda does without scanning multiple lines.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Keeping simple lambdas compact minimizes the vertical space they occupy.
  This allows developers to see more code on the screen at once, making it easier to understand the overall logic.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Compact lambda expressions are easier to scan when reading through code.
  Developers can quickly identify what transformations or operations are being performed without getting lost in excessive line breaks.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Short lambda expressions read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows common conventions in functional programming and makes the code more intuitive.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  When a lambda is simple enough to fit on one line, keeping it compact emphasizes that it is a simple, straightforward operation.
  This helps distinguish simple lambdas from more complex ones that require multiple lines.

- **Easier Code Maintenance**:
  Compact lambda expressions are easier to modify and update.
  Developers can make changes to simple lambdas without disrupting the overall structure of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the expression body of the lambda to the same line as the lambda parameters and arrow.
Ensure that the complete lambda expression fits comfortably on a single line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6043
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6043
```
