# MiKo_6064: Place identifier invocations on same line

## Cause

Invocations of identifiers span multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when invocations of identifiers span a single line.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Keeping identifier invocations on a single line is essential for maintaining clean and understandable code.
When simple identifier invocations are split across multiple lines without good reason, they create unnecessary complexity and make the code harder to follow, especially when the invocation itself is straightforward.

Placing identifier invocations on the same line provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Single-line identifier invocations make the code immediately clear.
  Developers can see what identifier is being called without having to trace across multiple lines.

- **Better Code Density**:
  Keeping simple invocations on one line allows more code to be visible at once.
  This helps developers understand the broader context without excessive scrolling.

- **Reduced Visual Noise**:
  Single-line invocations reduce visual clutter and make the code easier to parse.
  Unnecessary line breaks create visual noise that distracts from the actual logic.

- **Enhanced Readability**:
  When identifier invocations are on single lines, the reading flow is natural and uninterrupted.
  The code becomes easier to read and comprehend quickly.

- **Clearer Code Structure**:
  Single-line invocations help maintain clear code structure by keeping simple operations compact.
  This makes it easier to distinguish between simple and complex operations.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Compact identifier invocations are easier to modify or refactor.
  The single-line format makes it obvious what needs to be changed and reduces the chance of formatting errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the entire identifier invocation on a single line.
Combine the identifier name and any associated invocation syntax onto one line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6064
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6064
```
