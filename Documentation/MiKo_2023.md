# MiKo_2023: Start Boolean parameter documentation with default phrase

## Cause

Documentation for a Boolean parameter does not follow the standard format for describing true and false cases.

## Rule description

For Boolean parameters, documentation should explicitly describe the `true` case followed by the `false` case.
Use the format `<see langword="true"/> to indicate that ...; otherwise, <see langword="false"/>.`.
This aligns with best practices and provides clarity for developers.

### Rationale behind

Boolean parameters represent binary choices, and their documentation must clearly explain what each value means.
Following a consistent format ensures developers always know what happens when they pass true or false.

Using the standard Boolean parameter documentation format provides several important benefits:

- **Complete Information**:
  Documenting both the true and false cases provides complete information about the parameter's behavior.
  Developers understand the full impact of their choice without needing to examine the implementation.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework uses this exact pattern for Boolean parameter documentation throughout the base class library.
  Following the same convention creates consistency with framework APIs.

- **Clear Decision Making**:
  When developers see what each Boolean value does, they can make informed decisions about which value to pass.
  This leads to more correct and intentional code.

- **Proper Formatting**:
  Using `<see langword="true" />` and `<see langword="false" />` creates properly formatted keywords in IntelliSense.
  This makes the documentation more readable and professional.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Explicitly stating what true and false mean eliminates any ambiguity about the parameter's behavior.
  This is especially important when parameter names might be unclear or when there are multiple Boolean parameters.

- **Professional Standards**:
  Following established documentation patterns demonstrates attention to quality and adherence to best practices.
  This makes the API appear more polished and well-designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the Boolean parameter documentation to follow the standard format.

Use the pattern: `<see langword="true"/> to [description of true case]; otherwise, <see langword="false"/>.`
Clearly describe what happens when the parameter is true, followed by what happens when it is false.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2023
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2023
```
