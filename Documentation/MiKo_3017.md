# MiKo_3017: Include original exception when throwing new exceptions

## Cause

Code catches an exception and throws a new exception without including the original exception as an inner exception.

## Rule description

When catching an exception and throwing a new one, include the caught exception as an inner exception.
This approach makes debugging easier by preserving the original exception, helping to trace the root cause efficiently.

### Rationale behind

When exceptions are thrown without preserving the original exception, critical diagnostic information is lost.
The stack trace and details from the original exception are essential for understanding the root cause of failures.

Including the original exception as an inner exception provides several important benefits:

- **Complete Stack Traces**:
  Inner exceptions preserve the full call stack from where the original error occurred.
  This is essential for understanding the sequence of events that led to the failure.

- **Faster Debugging**:
  With the complete exception chain, developers can trace problems back to their source.
  Missing inner exceptions force developers to recreate scenarios to find root causes.

- **Better Error Logs**:
  Logging frameworks typically capture inner exceptions and their stack traces.
  This provides comprehensive diagnostic information for troubleshooting production issues.

- **Preserved Context**:
  The original exception contains valuable information like error messages and state.
  Discarding it loses context that might be critical for understanding the problem.

- **Easier Root Cause Analysis**:
  When multiple layers wrap exceptions, the innermost exception reveals the true cause.
  Without the exception chain, finding the root cause becomes significantly harder.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, include the caught exception as the inner exception when throwing a new exception.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3017
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3017
```
