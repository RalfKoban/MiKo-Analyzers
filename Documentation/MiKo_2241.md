# MiKo_2241: Do not use `empty string` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation uses the phrase `empty string` instead of the proper notation with a reference to string.Empty.

## Rule description

XML documentation shall not use the phrase `empty string`.
Instead, use the phrase `<see cref="string.Empty"/> string ("")` to clearly express the concept and provide hyperlink support.
This improves readability and developer understanding.

### Rationale behind

The phrase `empty string` is ambiguous and does not provide any way for developers to navigate to related documentation or understand the precise meaning.
Using proper XML documentation tags with code references makes the concept clear and actionable.

Using proper notation for empty strings provides several important benefits:

- **Provides Navigation**:
  The `<see cref="string.Empty"/>` tag creates a clickable link in IntelliSense and documentation.
  Developers can navigate directly to the string.Empty documentation if needed.

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  The notation makes it absolutely clear that the documentation refers to a string with zero length.
  `Empty string` could be misunderstood or interpreted differently.

- **Shows Both Representations**:
  Including both the constant reference and the literal representation ("") helps developers understand both ways to represent an empty string.
  This is educational and comprehensive.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When documentation includes `<see cref>` tags, IntelliSense renders them as formatted references.
  This makes tooltips more informative and professional.

- **Consistent Documentation Style**:
  Using XML tags for code references follows .NET documentation conventions.
  This creates consistency across the codebase.

- **Compiler Validation**:
  The compiler validates `<see cref>` references, ensuring they point to valid code elements.
  This prevents documentation from becoming outdated if APIs change.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the phrase `empty string` with `<see cref="string.Empty"/> string ("")` in documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2241
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2241
```
