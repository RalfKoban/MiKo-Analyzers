# MiKo_3014: Include reason in `InvalidOperationException`, `NotImplementedException` and `NotSupportedException` messages

## Cause

An `InvalidOperationException`, `NotImplementedException`, or `NotSupportedException` is thrown without a descriptive message explaining the reason.

## Rule description

For easier maintenance, include a reason when throwing an `InvalidOperationException`, `NotImplementedException`, or `NotSupportedException`.
This reason should explain the circumstances of the exception and ideally provide guidance on how to resolve it.
This practice ensures that developers understand why the exception was thrown and how to address it, making the code easier to maintain and debug.

### Rationale behind

Exceptions without descriptive messages provide no context about why they were thrown.
When developers encounter these exceptions, they must read through code to understand the problem, wasting valuable time.

Including descriptive reasons in exception messages provides several important benefits:

- **Faster Problem Resolution**:
  Clear exception messages explain what went wrong and often suggest how to fix it.
  Developers can resolve issues without extensive investigation.

- **Better Debugging Experience**:
  Exception messages appear in logs and debugging tools.
  Descriptive messages turn exceptions into valuable diagnostic information.

- **Improved Code Maintainability**:
  When exceptions explain the reason for failure, future maintainers can understand the code's expectations.
  This makes it easier to modify the code without breaking existing logic.

- **Enhanced User Experience**:
  In some cases, exception messages may be displayed to users or logged for support.
  Clear messages help support teams assist users more effectively.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  Exception messages document the conditions under which operations fail.
  This serves as inline documentation that stays synchronized with the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, provide a descriptive message when creating the exception that explains why the exception is thrown and ideally how to resolve it.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3014
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3014
```
