# MiKo_2310: Explain the `Why` instead of the `That` in comments

## Cause

A comment states that an intention exists without explaining what the intention actually is.

## Rule description

Instead of simply stating *that* an intention exists, comments should clearly explain *what* the intention actually is.
This provides developers with valuable background information, enabling them to make more informed decisions based on that context.
Clear intentions help convey the purpose and reasoning behind code, which is crucial for effective collaboration and maintenance.

### Rationale behind

Comments that only state "that" something has an intention without explaining what it is leave developers with incomplete information.
They are left to guess or investigate the code to understand the actual purpose, which wastes time and increases the risk of misunderstanding.

Explaining the actual intention provides several important benefits:

- **Enables Informed Decisions**:
  When developers understand the specific intention behind code, they can make better decisions about how to use, modify, or extend it.
  They know what goals the code is trying to achieve.

- **Prevents Misuse**:
  Clear comments about intentions help developers use code correctly and avoid using it in ways that violate its intended purpose.
  This reduces bugs and unexpected behavior.

- **Improves Maintainability**:
  When the intention is clearly documented, future maintainers can understand why the code exists and whether changes align with or violate that intention.
  This prevents accidental breaking changes.

- **Reduces Investigation Time**:
  Developers do not need to read through implementation details to understand the purpose of code.
  Clear comments about intentions save time and improve productivity.

- **Facilitates Collaboration**:
  When all team members understand the intentions behind code, they can work together more effectively.
  Communication becomes easier and misunderstandings are reduced.

- **Supports Better Design**:
  Writing comments that explain intentions forces developers to think clearly about what code is supposed to achieve.
  This often leads to better design decisions and clearer implementation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace vague statements about intentions with clear explanations of what the intention actually is.
Provide specific details about the purpose and goals of the code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2310
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2310
```
