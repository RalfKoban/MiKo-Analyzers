# MiKo_3048: Apply [ValueConversion] attribute to ValueConverters

## Cause

A class implementing `IValueConverter` does not have a `[ValueConversion]` attribute.

## Rule description

Decorate implementations of the IValueConverter interface with the [ValueConversion] attribute to signal to development tools the data types involved in a conversion.
This practice enhances clarity and improves tool support, making the code easier to work with and maintain.

### Rationale behind

Value converters in WPF transform data between the view and view model layers.
The ValueConversion attribute provides metadata about what types are converted, which benefits both developers and tools.

Applying ValueConversion attributes provides several important benefits:

- **Enhanced Tool Support**:
  Design tools and analyzers can use the attribute to validate bindings.
  This helps catch type mismatches during development rather than at runtime.

- **Self-Documenting Code**:
  The attribute clearly indicates what types the converter works with.
  Developers do not need to read the conversion logic to understand the converter's purpose.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  Some tools use the attribute to provide better autocomplete suggestions.
  This helps developers select appropriate converters for their binding scenarios.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  The expected input and output types are explicit and easy to find.
  Changes to converter behavior can be validated against these declared types.

- **Design-Time Validation**:
  XAML designers can warn about incompatible type conversions.
  This catches errors before the application runs, saving debugging time.

- **Improved Code Quality**:
  The attribute encourages developers to think about type contracts when implementing converters.
  This leads to more robust and well-designed conversion logic.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `[ValueConversion]` attribute to the class.
Specify the source type as the first parameter and the target type as the second parameter.
Ensure the types match what the converter actually handles in its `Convert` and `ConvertBack` methods.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3048
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3048
```
