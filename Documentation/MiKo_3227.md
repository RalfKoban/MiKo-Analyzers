# MiKo_3227: Use pattern matching for equality checks

## Cause

An equality check uses the `==` operator instead of `is` pattern matching.

## Rule description

Equality checks using `is` pattern matching are more intuitive and easier to read than the `==` equality operator.
This makes them the preferred choice for clarity and comprehension.

### Rationale behind

Pattern matching provides a more expressive and modern syntax for equality checks.
The `is` keyword reads more naturally in many contexts and integrates well with other pattern matching features.

Using pattern matching for equality checks provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Pattern matching syntax reads more naturally in many contexts.
  The `is` keyword flows better in conditional statements than the `==` operator.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching creates consistency with other pattern-based checks like type tests.
  Developers can use a unified syntax for different kinds of pattern matching.

- **Enhanced Expressiveness**:
  Pattern matching supports additional features like property patterns and logical patterns.
  This makes the code more expressive and powerful.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `is` keyword explicitly communicates that a pattern is being matched.
  This makes the code's purpose more obvious.

- **Modern Syntax**:
  Pattern matching is a modern C# feature that represents current best practices.
  Using it keeps the codebase up to date with language evolution.

- **Future Compatibility**:
  Code written with pattern matching is ready for future enhancements to the feature.
  New pattern types can be adopted more easily.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `==` equality operator with the `is` pattern matching syntax.
Use the constant pattern form of `is` for equality checks.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3227
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3227
```
