# MiKo_6045: Place comparisons using operators such as `==` or `!=` on same line(s)

## Cause

Comparison operators and their operands are split across multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when comparison operators such as `==` or `!=` are placed on the same lines as their operands.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Comparison operations are fundamental to program logic, forming the basis of conditional statements and loops.
When comparisons are split across multiple lines, the relationship between the values being compared becomes less clear and harder to understand.

Placing comparison operators and operands on the same lines provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The complete comparison is visible at a glance, making it immediately clear what values are being compared and how.
  Developers can understand the condition without scanning multiple lines.

- **Clearer Logic Flow**:
  Compact comparison operations make it easier to understand the logic of conditional statements.
  Developers can quickly identify what conditions must be met for certain code paths to execute.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When comparisons fit on one line, they can be processed as single units of information.
  Developers do not need to mentally combine pieces from multiple lines to understand the comparison.

- **Better Code Scanning**:
  Compact comparisons make it easier to scan through code and identify conditional logic.
  This is especially helpful when reviewing complex algorithms or business rules.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Comparison expressions read naturally when kept on one line.
  This follows the standard mathematical and logical notation that developers are familiar with.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  When comparisons are compact, it is easier to evaluate them during debugging sessions.
  Developers can quickly check the values on both sides of the operator and understand why a condition evaluated to true or false.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the comparison operator and both operands to the same line.
Ensure that the complete comparison expression is on a single line when reasonable.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6045
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6045
```
