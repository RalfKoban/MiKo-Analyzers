# MiKo_6061: Place switch expression arms on same line

## Cause

Switch expression arms span multiple lines.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when switch expression arms span a single line.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Keeping switch expression arms on a single line is essential for maintaining concise and readable switch expressions.
When arms are unnecessarily split across multiple lines, the switch expression becomes longer and harder to understand, obscuring the mapping between patterns and their corresponding results.

Placing switch expression arms on the same line provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Single-line arms make it easy to see the relationship between each pattern and its result value.
  The concise format allows developers to understand the entire expression at a glance.

- **Better Pattern Matching Visibility**:
  When each arm is on a single line, the pattern matching logic becomes more visible.
  Developers can quickly compare different patterns and their corresponding results.

- **Reduced Vertical Space**:
  Single-line arms keep switch expressions compact, reducing the vertical space required.
  This allows more code to fit on the screen, making it easier to understand the broader context.

- **Easier Comparison**:
  When all arms follow the same single-line format, it is much easier to compare them side-by-side.
  This helps identify patterns, inconsistencies, or potential simplifications.

- **Enhanced Scanability**:
  A list of single-line arms is much easier to scan through than a collection of multi-line blocks.
  Developers can quickly locate specific patterns or results without having to parse through extra lines.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Adding, removing, or modifying arms is simpler when they are single lines.
  The consistent format makes changes less error-prone and easier to review.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the entire switch expression arm on a single line.
Combine the pattern, the arrow operator, and the result value into one line.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6061
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6061
```
