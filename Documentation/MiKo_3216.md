# MiKo_3216: Mark static fields with initializers as read-only

## Cause

A static field has a pre-assigned value but is not marked as `readonly`.

## Rule description

Static fields with pre-assigned values are likely meant to remain unchanged.
Therefore, make these fields `readonly`.
This ensures their values remain constant and clearly communicates their intended use.

### Rationale behind

Static fields that are initialized but not marked `readonly` can be modified anywhere in the code.
If the field is not intended to change after initialization, it should be marked `readonly` to prevent accidental modification.

Marking static fields as read-only provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Safety**:
  Read-only fields cannot be accidentally modified after initialization.
  This prevents bugs caused by unexpected state changes.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `readonly` keyword explicitly communicates that the field should not change.
  Developers immediately understand the field's constancy.

- **Better Thread Safety**:
  Read-only fields are inherently thread-safe after initialization.
  Multiple threads can access them without synchronization concerns.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Knowing a field cannot change makes code easier to reason about.
  Developers do not need to track potential modifications.

- **Prevented Errors**:
  The compiler prevents accidental assignments to read-only fields.
  This catches potential bugs at compile time.

- **Performance Benefits**:
  Read-only fields can be optimized more aggressively by the compiler and runtime.
  This can lead to better performance in some cases.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `readonly` modifier to the static field declaration.
If the field needs to be modified after initialization, consider whether it should be a constant or if the modification is truly necessary.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3216
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3216
```
