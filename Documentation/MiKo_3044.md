# MiKo_3044: Use `nameof` to compare property names of PropertyChangingEventArgs and PropertyChangedEventArgs

## Cause

Property name comparisons use string literals instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

Use the `nameof` operator to compare property names provided by `PropertyChangingEventArgs` and `PropertyChangedEventArgs`.
This avoids typos and invalid names and makes refactoring easier, as `nameof` ensures property names are automatically updated during renames, unlike strings.

### Rationale behind

Property change event handlers often check which property changed by comparing the property name from EventArgs.
Using string literals for these comparisons creates the same risks as using them for event raising.

Using `nameof` for comparisons provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Safety**:
  The compiler verifies that compared properties exist on the class.
  String literals can reference properties that do not exist or have been renamed, causing handlers to fail silently.

- **Automatic Refactoring**:
  When properties are renamed, all `nameof` comparisons are automatically updated.
  String literal comparisons remain unchanged, causing event handlers to stop working without any compile-time warning.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Using `nameof` for both raising and handling property changes establishes consistency.
  This makes the codebase more uniform and easier to understand.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that property name comparisons are correct.
  String literals require checking against property definitions to ensure they match.

- **Reduced Bugs**:
  Typos in property name comparisons are eliminated.
  These bugs can be subtle, causing handlers to silently ignore property changes they should respond to.

- **Better IDE Support**:
  IntelliSense helps developers write correct comparisons.
  "Find All References" shows where properties are checked in event handlers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace string literals with the `nameof` operator in property name comparisons.
Change `if (e.PropertyName == "MyProperty")` to `if (e.PropertyName == nameof(MyProperty))`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3044
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3044
```
