# MiKo_1400: Use plural for namespace names

## Cause

A namespace name uses singular form instead of plural.

## Rule description

Namespaces should use plural forms (e.g., `Controllers`, `Models`, `Services`) rather than singular forms.
This follows .NET naming conventions and makes namespaces more intuitive.

### Rationale behind

Using plural forms for namespace names is a [fundamental .NET convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-namespaces) that reflects the purpose of namespaces as containers for multiple related types.
A namespace like `Controllers` indicates that it contains multiple controller classes, making the organizational structure immediately clear.

This convention provides several important benefits:

- **Alignment with .NET Framework**:
  Plural namespace names align with the official .NET Framework Design Guidelines.
  This creates consistency across the .NET ecosystem, making codebases more accessible to developers who work on different projects.

- **Natural Readability**:
  Plural names read more naturally when qualified with the full namespace path.
  They clearly indicate that the namespace is a container for multiple types.

- **Improved Professional Appearance**:
  Following standard conventions makes the code structure look more professional and well-designed.
  It shows attention to detail and adherence to industry best practices.

- **Better Onboarding**:
  Developers who are new to the codebase can immediately understand the structure.
  The familiar naming pattern reduces the learning curve for team members.

- **Consistency Across Projects**:
  When all projects follow the same convention, developers can move between codebases more easily.
  This is especially valuable for open-source contributions and consulting work.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the namespace name to use the plural form.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1400
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1400
```
