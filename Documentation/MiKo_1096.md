# MiKo_1096: Use `Failed` instead of `NotSuccessful` in names

## Cause

A name contains `NotSuccessful` instead of `Failed`.

## Rule description

To be more explicit and direct, names should use `Failed` instead of `NotSuccesful`.

### Rationale behind

Using `NotSuccessful` instead of `Failed` creates unnecessarily wordy and awkward names that are harder to read and understand.
The term `Failed` is more direct, concise, and commonly used in programming to indicate that an operation did not complete successfully.

Double negatives and complex constructions like `NotSuccessful` require more mental effort to parse and understand.

Using `Failed` instead of `NotSuccessful` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  `Failed` is shorter and more direct than `NotSuccessful`.
  Developers can immediately understand what the name means without having to mentally parse a negative construction.

- **Better Code Consistency**:
  Most programming conventions and frameworks use `Failed` rather than `NotSuccessful`.
  Following this convention makes code more consistent with industry standards and easier to understand for developers from different backgrounds.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  `Failed` is a strong, clear term that leaves no ambiguity about what happened.
  `NotSuccessful` is weaker and requires mental translation to understand the actual state.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Simple, direct terms like `Failed` require less mental effort to process.
  This makes code easier to read quickly and reduces the chance of misunderstanding.

- **More Natural Language**:
  `Failed` is how people naturally describe unsuccessful operations in everyday language.
  Using natural language in code makes it more intuitive and accessible, especially for less experienced developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `NotSuccessful` with `Failed`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1096
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1096
```
