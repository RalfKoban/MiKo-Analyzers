# MiKo_4101: Place test initialization methods directly after One-Time methods

## Cause

Test initialization methods are not placed directly after one-time test initialization and cleanup methods.

## Rule description

Test initialization methods define the common parts of tests.
To make them easy to find, place them directly after all one-time test initialization/cleanup methods and before all test methods.

### Rationale behind

Test initialization methods set up the common state needed by individual tests, while one-time methods set up the shared environment for all tests.

Organizing these setup methods in a consistent order creates a clear hierarchy that reflects when each setup occurs: once for the entire test class, then before each individual test.

Placing test initialization methods directly after one-time methods provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Setup Hierarchy**:
  The order of methods reflects the order of execution: one-time setup first, then per-test setup, then actual tests.
  This makes the test flow intuitive and easy to understand.

- **Easier Test Debugging**:
  When tests fail, developers often need to check the setup code.
  Having all initialization methods grouped at the top in execution order makes it quick to review what happens before tests run.

- **Better Test Understanding**:
  New developers can read the test class from top to bottom and naturally understand how the test environment is prepared.
  The progression from global setup to individual setup to tests is logical and clear.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  When updating test setup, having all initialization methods in one predictable location makes it easier to make consistent changes.
  Developers do not need to search through the file to find setup code.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  A consistent structure across all test classes means developers always know where to look for initialization logic.
  This reduces mental effort and makes working with tests faster.

- **Enhanced Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly verify that tests are set up correctly by checking the initialization methods in their expected locations.
  The predictable structure makes review more efficient.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the test initialization methods so they appear directly after any one-time test initialization or cleanup methods.

Place them before all actual test methods to maintain the setup-then-test order.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_4101
#pragma warning restore MiKo_4101
```
