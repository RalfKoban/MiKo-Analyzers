# MiKo_6035: Place open parenthesis on same line(s) as invoked methods

## Cause

Open parentheses are placed on different lines than the invoked methods.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when the open parenthesis are placed on the same lines as the invoked methods.
This makes the code easier to follow and understand.

### Rationale behind

When open parentheses are separated from their method names, it disrupts the natural flow of reading code.
Developers have to mentally connect the method name with its parameter list across multiple lines, which makes the code harder to understand.

Keeping open parentheses on the same lines as invoked methods provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The method name and its parameter list form a clear, cohesive unit.
  Developers can immediately see that parameters belong to a specific method without having to scan across lines.

- **Natural Code Flow**:
  Method calls read naturally when the opening parenthesis follows directly after the method name.
  This follows the standard syntax pattern that developers expect to see in C# code.

- **Reduced Visual Clutter**:
  Keeping method names and parentheses together reduces the number of lines needed to express the same logic.
  This makes it easier to see more code at once and understand the overall structure.

- **Easier Code Navigation**:
  When searching for method calls or parameters, having the opening parenthesis on the same line makes it easier to locate and identify specific invocations.
  Developers can quickly scan the code to find where a particular method is being called.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Placing parentheses with their methods creates a uniform pattern throughout the codebase.
  This consistency reduces the mental effort required to understand different parts of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move the open parenthesis to the same line as the invoked method name.
Ensure that the method name and its opening parenthesis are always kept together.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6035
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6035
```
