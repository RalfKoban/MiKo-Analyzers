# MiKo_2301: Do not use obvious comments in AAA-Tests

## Cause

Test code following the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern contains obvious comments like `// arrange`, `// act`, and `// assert`.

## Rule description

In test code following the Arrange/Act/Assert style, comments like `// arrange`, `// act`, and `// assert` are redundant.
They do not add any value since the structure is already clear.
Removing them keeps the code clean and focused on the actual logic, enhancing readability and maintainability.

### Rationale behind

The Arrange/Act/Assert pattern is a widely recognized testing convention.
Developers familiar with this pattern can immediately identify the three sections without explicit comments.
Adding obvious comments creates visual clutter without providing useful information.

Removing obvious AAA comments provides several important benefits:

- **Reduces Visual Clutter**:
  Comments that state the obvious take up space without adding value.
  Removing them makes test code cleaner and easier to scan.

- **Trusts Developer Knowledge**:
  Developers working with tests should be familiar with the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern.
  Obvious comments suggest a lack of trust in readers` competence.

- **Improves Readability**:
  Well-structured test code is self-explanatory.
  Empty lines between sections provide sufficient visual separation without needing comments.

- **Focuses on Important Comments**:
  When obvious comments are removed, any remaining comments stand out as actually important.
  This makes it easier to spot meaningful documentation.

- **Consistent with Best Practices**:
  Modern testing guidelines recommend against obvious comments.
  Following this practice aligns with industry standards.

- **Encourages Better Structure**:
  Instead of relying on comments, developers are encouraged to make the test structure clear through formatting and organization.
  This leads to better test design.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove obvious comments like `// arrange`, `// act`, and `// assert` from test code.
Use empty lines to separate the sections if needed.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2301
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2301
```
