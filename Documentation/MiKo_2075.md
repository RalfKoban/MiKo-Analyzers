# MiKo_2075: Use `callback` instead of `action`, `func` or `function` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses terms like `action`, `func`, or `function` when referring to delegate parameters.

## Rule description

XML documentation is for other developers.
When referring to `Action` or `Func` delegates, there is no need to call them `action`, `func`, or `function`, as the type information is already clear.
Instead, refer to them as `callback` since these delegates act as references to specific methods and serve as callbacks within the code.

### Rationale behind

Delegates like Action and Func are not just functions or actions, they are callback mechanisms that allow code to call back into other code.
Using terms like `action` or `func` merely restates the type name without explaining the parameter's actual role.

The term `callback` better describes how these parameters are used in practice.
They represent code that will be called back at a specific point during execution, which is a more meaningful description than simply repeating the type name.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Purpose**:
  The term `callback` describes the role and usage pattern rather than just the type.

- **Better Understanding**:
  Developers immediately grasp that the parameter represents code to be executed at a later point.

- **Consistent Terminology**:
  Using `callback` aligns with common programming terminology used across many languages and frameworks.

- **More Informative Documentation**:
  Documentation that explains the role rather than repeating the type name provides more value to readers.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  Avoiding repetition of type information that is already visible in the method signature keeps documentation concise.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace terms like `action`, `func`, or `function` with `callback` in the documentation.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2075
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2075
