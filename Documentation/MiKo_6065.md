# MiKo_6065: Indent rather than outdent consecutive invocations spanning multiple lines

## Cause

Consecutive invocations spanning multiple lines are outdented rather than indented.

## Rule description

Code readability improves when invocations spanning multiple lines are vertically indented.
This makes the code clearer and easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Indenting consecutive invocations is crucial for maintaining clear visual hierarchy and code flow, especially in fluent interfaces and method chaining.
When invocations are indented rather than outdented, it creates a clear visual structure that shows the relationship between consecutive calls, making the code flow easier to understand.

Indenting rather than outdenting consecutive invocations spanning multiple lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**:
  Indentation creates a visual hierarchy that shows consecutive invocations are part of a chain or sequence.
  This makes the relationship between calls immediately obvious.

- **Better Code Flow Understanding**:
  Indented invocations help developers understand the flow of method chaining.
  Each indented line clearly continues from the previous one, making the sequence of operations easy to follow.

- **Improved Readability**:
  When invocations are indented, the code is easier to read because the visual structure matches the logical structure.
  The indentation guides the eye through the chain of operations.

- **Easier Debugging**:
  Indented method chains are easier to debug because each step is visually distinct.
  Developers can quickly identify which invocation in the chain might be causing an issue.

- **Consistent Code Style**:
  Indentation follows standard coding conventions for showing continuation and relationship.
  This consistency makes the codebase more predictable and professional.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When invocations are properly indented, adding or removing calls from the chain is straightforward.
  The clear structure makes modifications less error-prone.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, indent consecutive invocations rather than outdenting them.
Ensure each continuation of the invocation chain is indented to show its relationship to the previous call.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6065
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6065
```
