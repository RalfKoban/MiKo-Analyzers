# MiKo_3401: Keep namespace hierarchies from becoming too deep

## Cause

A namespace hierarchy exceeds the maximum allowed depth.

## Rule description

Keep namespace hierarchies shallow.
If a namespace hierarchy becomes too deep, it likely means the namespaces are too specific or specialized.
Flatten such namespaces to keep your codebase understandable and manageable.

### Rationale behind

Deep namespace hierarchies create unnecessarily complex organizational structures.
They make it harder to find and understand code, and often indicate over-engineering of the namespace structure.

Keeping namespace hierarchies shallow provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Shallower namespaces are easier to navigate and search.
  Developers can find types more quickly without traversing deep hierarchies.

- **Better Usability**:
  Shorter namespace names are easier to type and remember.
  They reduce the verbosity of using statements and fully qualified names.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Simpler namespace structures are easier to understand and maintain.
  Developers do not need to understand deeply nested organizational concepts.

- **Clearer Organization**:
  Flat namespaces encourage grouping types by broad functionality rather than over-specialization.
  This often leads to better organization aligned with actual usage patterns.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Shallower hierarchies are easier to refactor when requirements change.
  Moving types between namespaces becomes simpler.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Avoiding deep hierarchies aligns with .NET Framework and library conventions.
  This makes the codebase feel more familiar to developers.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, flatten the namespace hierarchy.
Combine overly specific namespace segments or reorganize types into broader categories.
Consider whether the deep hierarchy adds real organizational value or just complexity.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3401
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3401
```
