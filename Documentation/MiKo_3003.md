# MiKo_3003: Follow .NET Framework Design Guidelines for events

## Cause

An event does not follow the [.NET Framework Design Guidelines for Event Design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/event).

## Rule description

To ease usage, events should follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for Event Design.

### Rationale behind

Events that do not follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines are inconsistent with the patterns .NET developers expect.
This makes the API harder to use and understand, especially for developers who are familiar with standard .NET event patterns.

Following the .NET Framework Design Guidelines for events provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Consistency**:
  Standard event patterns are familiar to all .NET developers.
  This makes the API intuitive and reduces the learning curve.

- **Better IDE Support**:
  Many development tools and frameworks expect events to follow standard patterns.
  Compliance ensures better IntelliSense support and automatic code generation.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  Developers know what to expect when they see an event signature.
  Standard patterns make it easier to find and use events correctly.

- **Easier Integration**:
  Third-party libraries and frameworks often rely on standard event patterns.
  Following the guidelines ensures seamless integration with existing tools.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Standard event patterns include best practices for thread safety and proper argument handling.
  Following them helps prevent common mistakes in event implementation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, modify the event to follow the .NET Framework Design Guidelines.
Ensure the event uses the standard `EventHandler` or `EventHandler<TEventArgs>` delegate pattern.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3003
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3003
```
