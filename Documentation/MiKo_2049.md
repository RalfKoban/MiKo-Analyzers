# MiKo_2049: Use explicit wording instead of `will be` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation uses `will be` instead of more explicit wording.

## Rule description

The term `will be` is not specific enough and it uses the future tense, which is not accurate for describing the current behavior or state of the code.
Using `is` instead gets straight to the point and employs the present tense, accurately reflecting the current behavior.
This practice ensures clarity and precision, making the code's behavior easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Documentation should describe what the code does, not what it will do in the future.
Using present tense creates clear, direct statements about the code's behavior, while future tense can create ambiguity and make documentation feel less confident.

Using explicit wording instead of `will be` provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Present Behavior**:
  Using `is` instead of `will be` makes it clear that the documentation describes the current behavior of the code.
  There is no ambiguity about when the described behavior occurs.

- **Direct Communication**:
  Present tense is more direct and assertive than future tense.
  It communicates what the code does with confidence and clarity.

- **Reduced Ambiguity**:
  Future tense can create confusion about whether the behavior happens now or at some point in the future.
  Present tense eliminates this ambiguity.

- **Professional Documentation**:
  Technical documentation typically uses present tense to describe how systems work.
  Following this convention makes the documentation feel more professional and authoritative.

- **Better Readability**:
  Present tense documentation is easier to read and understand.
  Developers can quickly grasp what the code does without parsing future tense constructions.

- **Consistent Voice**:
  Using present tense consistently across the codebase creates a uniform documentation voice.
  This consistency improves the overall quality and professionalism of the documentation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace `will be` with `is` or other present tense wording that directly describes what the code does.
Ensure the documentation uses present tense throughout.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2049
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2049
```
