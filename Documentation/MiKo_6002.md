# MiKo_6002: Surround assertion statements with blank lines

## Cause

Assertions are not surrounded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Surround assertions with blank lines to visually separate them from the test code.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Surrounding assertion statements with blank lines is crucial for maintaining clear test structure and readability.
Assertions represent the verification phase of a test and are distinct from the arrangement and action phases, so visually separating them helps developers quickly understand the test structure and locate the actual verification logic.

Surrounding assertion statements with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Test Structure Visibility**:
  Blank lines make the different phases of a test (Arrange, Act, Assert) immediately visible.
  This helps developers understand the test organization at a glance.

- **Improved Test Readability**:
  When assertions are visually separated, tests are easier to read and comprehend.
  The blank lines guide the reader through the test flow naturally.

- **Better Focus on Verification Logic**:
  Visual separation draws attention to the assertions, which are the most important part of any test.
  Developers can quickly locate what is being verified.

- **Easier Test Maintenance**:
  When assertions are clearly separated, modifying or adding verifications is simpler.
  The visual boundaries make it obvious where the verification phase begins and ends.

- **Simplified Test Debugging**:
  During debugging, visually distinct assertions are easier to locate.
  Developers can quickly find the failing assertion without scanning through setup code.

- **Enhanced Code Review**:
  During code reviews, separated assertions make it easier to verify that tests are checking the correct behavior.
  Reviewers can focus on the assertions without being distracted by setup code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines before and after assertion statements.
Ensure each assertion or group of related assertions is visually separated from the test setup and action code.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6002
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6002
```
