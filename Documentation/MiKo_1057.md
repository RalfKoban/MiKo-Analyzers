# MiKo_1057: Suffix dependency property keys with `Key` (as in the .NET Framework)

## Cause

A field that backs a `DependencyPropertyKey` does not end with the suffix `Key`.

## Rule description

To show that fields are keys for specific dependency properties, add the suffix `Key` to their names.
This aligns with the naming conventions in the .NET Framework.

### Rationale behind

`DependencyPropertyKey` fields provide protected access to read-only dependency properties in WPF.
Without a consistent naming convention, it becomes difficult to distinguish these special key fields from regular `DependencyProperty` fields.

The .NET Framework establishes the convention of suffixing `DependencyPropertyKey` fields with `Key`.
Following this convention ensures code consistency and makes the codebase easier to understand for developers familiar with WPF.

Using the `Key` suffix for dependency property keys provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The `Key` suffix immediately identifies a field as a `DependencyPropertyKey` for read-only properties.
  Developers can quickly distinguish between regular `DependencyProperty` fields and their protected key counterparts.

- **Better Framework Consistency**:
  WPF controls in the .NET Framework follow this naming convention for read-only dependency properties.
  Using the same pattern makes custom controls feel native and professional.

- **Enhanced Discoverability**:
  When using IntelliSense or searching through code, the `Key` suffix makes it easy to find all read-only dependency properties in a class.
  This speeds up development and maintenance work.

- **Clearer Relationship**:
  The suffix makes it obvious which key field corresponds to which property.
  For example, `TextKey` clearly relates to the read-only `Text` property and its public `TextProperty` field.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  The `Key` suffix distinguishes the protected write access field from the public read access `DependencyProperty` field.
  This eliminates ambiguity about which field to use when setting the property internally.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `Key` suffix to the `DependencyPropertyKey` field name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1057
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1057
```
