# MiKo_2043: Start custom delegate `<summary>` documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A custom delegate type `<summary>` documentation does not start with the default phrase.

## Rule description

Custom delegate type documentation should start with `Encapsulates a method that...`. This phrase is crucial because a delegate refers to either a static method or an instance method of a class. Declaring a delegate type sets a contract specifying the method signatures it can encapsulate, clarifying its purpose and usage for developers.

### Rationale behind

Delegates are type-safe function pointers that encapsulate methods with specific signatures. Using a consistent starting phrase for delegate documentation helps developers immediately understand that the type is a delegate and what kind of methods it can reference.

Following a standard format for delegate documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Delegate Identity**: Starting delegate documentation with `Encapsulates a method that...` makes it immediately clear that the type is a delegate. Developers can quickly identify delegate types and understand their purpose.

- **Method Signature Clarity**: The standard phrase leads naturally into a description of what the encapsulated method does. This helps developers understand what kind of methods can be assigned to the delegate.

- **Consistent .NET Conventions**: The .NET Framework uses this pattern for delegate documentation, and following the same convention makes the codebase feel more aligned with .NET standards. This consistency improves the overall quality of the documentation.

- **Better Understanding of Callbacks**: Delegates are often used for callbacks and event handlers, and clear documentation helps developers understand how the delegate will be used. This improves the overall design understanding.

- **Improved Type Safety**: When delegate documentation clearly explains what methods can be encapsulated, developers can better ensure type safety when assigning methods to the delegate. This reduces errors and improves code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the delegate type documentation with the phrase `Encapsulates a method that...` followed by a description of what the encapsulated method does. Ensure the phrase clearly explains the delegate's purpose and the signature of methods it can reference.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2043
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2043
```
