# MiKo_1507: Do not suffix parameters with `Counter`

## Cause

A parameter name ends with `Counter`.

## Rule description

Parameters that hold values but are suffixed with `Counter` are most likely not holding counters but counted values instead.
So they should be named accordingly.

Using precise naming helps developers understand what the parameter represents and improves code clarity.

### Rationale behind

Method parameters form the contract between the caller and the called method.
Their names should clearly communicate what type of value is expected, not create ambiguity about whether an object or a value is being passed.

Using appropriate naming provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Method Signatures**:
  When developers see a method signature like `ProcessItems(int itemsCounter)`, they might wonder if it expects a Counter object.
  `ProcessItems(int itemCount)` or `ProcessItems(int itemsCounted)` removes all ambiguity.

- **Better API Documentation**:
  Auto-generated documentation and IntelliSense display parameter names.
  Clear names make the API easier to understand and use correctly without referring to additional documentation.

- **Reduced Caller Mistakes**:
  When calling methods, developers rely on parameter names to understand what values to pass.
  Misleading names increase the likelihood of passing incorrect values or types.

- **Easier Method Overloading**:
  If you need to create method overloads, having clear parameter names helps distinguish between different versions of the method.
  Ambiguous names make overloads harder to differentiate.

- **Improved Code Maintenance**:
  When modifying methods, developers need to understand what each parameter represents.
  Accurate parameter names reduce the time needed to understand and safely modify the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to replace `Counter` with `counted` or another appropriate term.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1507
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1507
```
