# MiKo_1026: Limit variable name length

## Cause

A variable name exceeds the maximum allowed character length.

## Rule description

Long names can be difficult to read and use, making both writing code and conducting code reviews more challenging.
Keeping names concise improves readability and efficiency.

Excessively long variable names make the code harder to read and can indicate that the variable represents a concept that is too complex.

### Rationale behind

Limiting variable name length is important for maintaining readable, maintainable code.
Overly long variable names create visual clutter and make code harder to scan, especially in methods with multiple local variables.
Long variable names can make expressions difficult to read, force awkward line breaks, and obscure the logic flow of the code.

Excessively long variable names often indicate that the variable is holding data that is too complex or that the name is trying to encode implementation details unnecessarily.
Well-written code uses variable names that are descriptive but concise, clearly indicating what the variable contains without excessive verbosity.

Keeping variable names concise provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Shorter variable names are easier to read and make code more scannable.
  Developers can quickly understand what data is being used without processing excessively long identifiers.

- **Better Expression Flow**:
  Concise variable names make expressions more compact and easier to understand.
  When variables are used in calculations, conditions, or LINQ queries, shorter names keep the code readable.

- **Enhanced Code Density**:
  Appropriately short variable names help keep code within reasonable line lengths.
  This reduces the need for awkward line breaks and keeps the logic flow clear.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  When variable names are concise, developers do not need to process as much text to understand what data is being manipulated.
  This makes it easier to follow the logic and understand what the code is doing.

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  Variables with concise names are easier to work with when refactoring or updating code.
  Changes are more straightforward when variable names are not excessively long.

- **Clearer Logic Flow**:
  When variable names are appropriately short, the overall flow of logic in a method becomes more apparent.
  Developers can focus on what the code does rather than parsing long variable names.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, shorten the variable name while preserving its essential meaning, using more concise terminology or context-appropriate abbreviations.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1026
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1026
```
