# MiKo_1116: Use present tense for test method names

## Cause

A test method name uses past tense instead of present tense.

## Rule description

Test method names should use present tense to describe what the test validates.
This makes them read more naturally and clearly.

### Rationale behind

Using present tense in test method names is important because it describes what the system does under test conditions, making tests read like living documentation.

Using present tense instead of past tense provides several important benefits:

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Present tense conveys that the test validates current, expected behavior rather than describing a past action.
  `Calculate_throws_ArgumentOutOfRangeException_for_negative_input` clearly states what should happen when the code runs.

- **Better Living Documentation**:
  Tests written in present tense serve as specifications of how the system behaves, not as historical records of what happened during one test execution.
  This makes test suites more valuable as documentation.

- **Improved Readability**:
  Present tense test names read more naturally and flow better when scanning through test suites.
  This makes it easier to understand what behaviors are covered by the tests.

- **Alignment with BDD Principles**:
  Present tense aligns with behavior-driven development principles where tests specify how the system behaves rather than what happened in a single test run.

- **Consistent Team Standards**:
  Using present tense creates a consistent pattern across all test names, making the test suite feel more cohesive and professional.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Past tense can make it unclear whether the test describes what should happen or what did happen in a previous execution.
  Present tense eliminates this ambiguity.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the test method name to use present tense.
