# MiKo_2019: Start `<summary>` documentation with third person singular verb (e.g., "Provides")

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation does not start with a third person singular verb.

## Rule description

`<summary>` documentation should always begin with a third person singular verb, such as `Provides`.
This concise description of the functionality that the class, property, etc. offers or represents ensures clarity and helps maintain a uniform documentation style.

### Rationale behind

Using third person singular verbs creates active, clear documentation that immediately communicates what a member does.
This grammatical structure is the standard convention in .NET documentation and technical writing.

Following this convention provides several important benefits:

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework consistently uses third person singular verbs to start all member documentation.
  Following the same pattern makes custom code feel like native framework code.

- **Clear and Concise**:
  Third person singular verbs create short, direct statements about what a member does.
  This makes documentation easier to read and understand at a glance.

- **Immediate Understanding**:
  Starting with an active verb immediately tells developers what the member provides or represents.
  They do not need to read through passive constructions or lengthy explanations.

- **Professional Style**:
  Third person singular is the standard grammatical form for technical documentation.
  Using it demonstrates adherence to professional writing standards.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  Concise verb-first documentation fits well in IntelliSense tooltips.
  Developers can quickly scan and understand the purpose without reading long sentences.

- **Consistent API Feel**:
  When all members follow the same grammatical pattern, the entire API feels consistent and well-designed.
  This makes the codebase easier to learn and use.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rewrite the documentation to start with a third person singular verb.

Use verbs like `Provides`, `Represents`, `Defines`, `Creates`, `Performs`, `Returns`, `Gets`, or `Sets` depending on what the member does.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2019
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2019
```
