# MiKo_3228: Use pattern matching for inequality checks

## Cause

An inequality check uses the `!=` operator instead of `is not` pattern matching.

## Rule description

Inequality checks using `is not` pattern matching are more intuitive and easier to read than the `!=` inequality operator.
This makes them the preferred choice for clarity and comprehension.

### Rationale behind

Pattern matching with the `is not` syntax provides a more expressive and readable way to check for inequality.
The syntax reads more naturally and integrates well with other pattern matching features in C#.

Using pattern matching for inequality checks provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  The `is not` syntax reads more naturally in many contexts.
  It flows better in conditional statements than the `!=` operator.

- **Better Consistency**:
  Using pattern matching creates consistency with equality checks and other pattern-based operations.
  Developers can use a unified syntax across different kinds of checks.

- **Enhanced Expressiveness**:
  Pattern matching supports additional features that can be combined with negation.
  This makes the code more expressive and flexible.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  The `is not` keywords explicitly communicate that a pattern is being negated.
  This makes the code's purpose immediately obvious.

- **Modern Syntax**:
  Pattern matching with negation is a modern C# feature that represents current best practices.
  Using it keeps the codebase aligned with language evolution.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  The `is not` syntax is easier to read in complex conditions.
  It reduces the mental effort needed to understand negated comparisons.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `!=` inequality operator with the `is not` pattern matching syntax.
Use the negated constant pattern form for inequality checks.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3228
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3228
```
