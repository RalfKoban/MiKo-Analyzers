# MiKo_1404: Do not use unspecific names for namespaces

## Cause

A namespace uses vague or unspecific names like `Common`, `General`, `Misc`, or `Utilities`.

## Rule description

Namespace names should clearly indicate their purpose and contents.
Vague names like `Common`, `General`, or `Misc` do not provide meaningful organization and often become dumping grounds for unrelated code.

### Rationale behind

Unspecific namespace names like `Common`, `Utilities`, or `Misc` are anti-patterns that indicate poor architectural planning.
These namespaces typically become catch-all locations where developers place code that they cannot immediately categorize.
This leads to low cohesion and unclear boundaries between components.

Using specific, descriptive namespace names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  Well-named namespaces make it easy to find code.
  Developers know where to look based on clear, descriptive names.

- **Better Cohesion**:
  Specific namespaces enforce clear boundaries and keep related functionality together.
  This prevents the accumulation of unrelated code in catch-all locations.

- **Clearer Dependencies**:
  When namespaces have specific purposes, dependencies between components become more visible and understandable.
  This makes it easier to manage and optimize the application architecture.

- **Prevented Technical Debt**:
  Requiring specific names prevents the creation of dumping ground namespaces.
  This stops technical debt from accumulating over time.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code in well-organized namespaces is easier to maintain and refactor.
  Developers understand where each piece of functionality belongs.

- **Self-Documenting Structure**:
  Specific namespace names reflect actual domain concepts and responsibilities.
  This makes the system structure self-documenting and easier to understand.

- **Easier Onboarding**:
  New team members can quickly understand the codebase structure when namespaces have clear, specific purposes.
  This reduces the learning curve and improves productivity.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reorganize the code into namespaces with more specific, descriptive names.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1404
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1404
```
