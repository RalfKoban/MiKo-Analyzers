# MiKo_2227: Remove ReSharper suppressions from documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains ReSharper suppression directives like `// ReSharper disable` or `// ReSharper disable once`.

## Rule description

ReSharper allows suppressing certain rules using inline comments like `// ReSharper disable` or `// ReSharper disable once`.
These suppressions can apply either once or until the document's end, or until the rule is re-enabled.
However, these suppressions should remain inline comments and must not be part of the XML documentation.
This keeps documentation clean and professional, ensuring it is not cluttered with tool-specific directives.

### Rationale behind

ReSharper suppressions are tool-specific directives that have no place in API documentation.
When these directives appear in XML documentation, they confuse readers and pollute the documentation with implementation details.

Keeping ReSharper suppressions out of XML documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Cleaner Documentation**:
  API documentation should focus on explaining what code does and how to use it.
  Tool-specific directives distract from this purpose and create visual noise.

- **Tool Independence**:
  Not all developers use ReSharper or even Visual Studio.
  Documentation should be useful regardless of what tools developers use.
  Including ReSharper directives makes documentation less universal.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Documentation that contains tool directives appears unprofessional and poorly maintained.
  Clean documentation reflects positively on code quality.

- **Better IntelliSense**:
  When ReSharper directives appear in XML comments, they show up in IntelliSense tooltips.
  This clutters the tooltips with irrelevant information that does not help developers understand how to use the code.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Developers who are not familiar with ReSharper may be confused by these directives appearing in documentation.
  Removing them makes documentation accessible to everyone.

- **Proper Separation of Concerns**:
  Code analysis suppressions are an implementation detail, while documentation describes the public API.
  These concerns should be kept separate.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move ReSharper suppression directives outside of XML documentation comments.
Place them as regular inline comments in the code instead.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2227
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2227
```
