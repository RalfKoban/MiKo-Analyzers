# MiKo_2076: Document default values of optional parameters

## Cause

An optional parameter does not have its default value documented.

## Rule description

In case a parameter is an optional one it is important to document its default value.
This is because the values of those optional parameters are "baked into" the calling code.

### Rationale behind

Optional parameters in .NET have a unique behavior where their default values are compiled directly into the calling assembly, not evaluated at runtime.
This means that if the default value changes in a library, existing compiled code will still use the old default value until it is recompiled.

When default values are not documented, developers calling the method cannot see what value will be used if they omit the parameter.
This lack of information makes it harder to understand the method's behavior and can lead to unexpected results.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Default Behavior**:
  Documenting default values makes it immediately clear what happens when a parameter is omitted.

- **Better IntelliSense Support**:
  Developers can see the default value directly in the documentation without having to look at the source code.

- **Improved Understanding**:
  Knowing the default value helps developers decide whether they need to provide an explicit value or can rely on the default.

- **Version Compatibility Awareness**:
  Documentation of default values reminds developers that these values are compiled into calling code, which is important for library versioning.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  When developers understand what default values are used, they are less likely to make incorrect assumptions about method behavior.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add documentation for the optional parameter that includes its default value.
Use phrasing like `The default value is...` or include the value in the parameter description.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2076
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2076
```
