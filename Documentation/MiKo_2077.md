# MiKo_2077: Do not include `<code>` in `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation contains `<code>` tags or code snippets.

## Rule description

`<summary>` documentation should not include `<code>` snippets.
The summary should be brief.
Code snippets, which typically serve as examples, should be placed in the `<example>` section instead.

### Rationale behind

The `<summary>` tag is designed to provide a quick, concise overview of what a member does.
It appears in IntelliSense and is meant to be read quickly while writing code.

Code snippets are typically longer and require more time to read and understand.
When placed in the summary, they make the documentation harder to scan and reduce the effectiveness of IntelliSense.

The `<example>` tag exists specifically for code samples and is the appropriate location for demonstrating usage.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  Keeping summaries brief ensures that IntelliSense tooltips are quick to read and do not clutter the screen.

- **Improved Scanability**:
  Short summaries allow developers to quickly understand multiple members without being overwhelmed by code examples.

- **Proper Organization**:
  Using the correct tags for different types of content makes documentation more structured and easier to navigate.

- **Clearer Purpose**:
  Summaries focus on describing what something does, while examples show how to use it.

- **Better Generated Documentation**:
  Documentation generation tools can format examples and summaries differently when they are properly separated.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move code snippets from the `<summary>` section to an `<example>` section.
Keep the summary focused on describing what the member does in plain text.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2077
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2077
```
