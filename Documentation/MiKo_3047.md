# MiKo_3047: Use `nameof` for applied [ContentProperty] attributes

## Cause

A `[ContentProperty]` attribute uses a string literal instead of the `nameof` operator.

## Rule description

Use the `nameof` operator instead of strings to define the properties for any applied [ContentProperty] attribute.
This prevents typos, ensures valid names, and makes rename refactoring much easier, as `nameof` ensures property names are automatically updated during renames, unlike strings.

### Rationale behind

The ContentProperty attribute in XAML-based applications specifies which property should receive content when the element is used in markup.
Using string literals for the property name creates the same maintenance problems as other string-based property references.

Using `nameof` with ContentProperty attributes provides several important benefits:

- **Compile-Time Safety**:
  The compiler verifies that the specified property exists on the class.
  String literals can reference non-existent properties, causing XAML parsing failures at runtime.

- **Automatic Refactoring**:
  When the content property is renamed, the attribute is automatically updated.
  String literals remain unchanged, breaking XAML markup that relies on the content property.

- **Early Error Detection**:
  Invalid property names are caught at compile time rather than when XAML is parsed.
  Runtime XAML errors can be difficult to diagnose and often appear in different locations.

- **Better IDE Support**:
  IntelliSense provides autocomplete when using `nameof`.
  Developers can quickly select the correct property without typing the full name.

- **Code Navigation**:
  "Go to Definition" works with `nameof`, allowing navigation to the property.
  String literals do not support this navigation feature.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Typos in property names are eliminated.
  These errors can cause confusing XAML behavior where content is not assigned as expected.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace string literals with the `nameof` operator.
Change `[ContentProperty("PropertyName")]` to `[ContentProperty(nameof(PropertyName))]`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3047
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3047
```
