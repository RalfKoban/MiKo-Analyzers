# MiKo_1050: Use descriptive names for return values

## Cause

A local variable used as a return value has a vague or generic name like `ret`, `retVal`, or `returnValue`.

## Rule description

Return variables should clearly describe the data they hold, not their technical aspect.
Use meaningful names instead of vague ones like `ret`, `retVal`, or `returnValue`.
It makes the code more readable and understandable.

### Rationale behind

When naming a variable that will be returned from a method, the name should describe **what** it represents, not **that** it will be returned.

Names like `ret`, `retVal`, `returnValue`, or similar variants provide no information about the actual purpose or content of the variable.
They only state the obvious - that the value will be returned.

Descriptive names improve code readability and help other developers (and the future self) understand what the code is doing without having to trace through the entire method.

Using descriptive return variable names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Descriptive names immediately convey what data the variable holds.
  Developers can understand the code without needing to trace through the entire method to figure out what is being returned.

- **Better Code Understanding**:
  When variable names describe their content rather than their technical role, the code becomes self-documenting.
  This reduces the need for additional comments explaining what each variable represents.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  When updating or debugging code, descriptive variable names make it easier to understand the flow of data through the method.
  This speeds up maintenance work and reduces the chance of introducing bugs.

- **Enhanced Consistency**:
  Using meaningful names that match the domain or business logic creates consistency across the codebase.
  This makes it easier for developers to work across different parts of the application.

The exception to this rule is when the variable name is `result` or `results`, which are acceptable generic names when the method's purpose is clear from its name and the specific type of result is self-evident.

## How to fix violations

Replace generic return value names with descriptive names that explain what the variable contains.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1050
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1050
```
