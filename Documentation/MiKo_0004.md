# MiKo_0004: Limit method parameters

## Cause

A method has too many parameters.

## Rule description

To follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), methods should use as few parameters as possible. When a method has too many parameters, it often indicates that the method is doing too much or that related parameters should be grouped together.

Methods with many parameters are harder to understand, use, and maintain, making the codebase more difficult to work with.

### Rationale behind

Methods with many parameters are difficult to understand and use. Having too many parameters makes method calls harder to read and increases the chance of passing arguments in the wrong order. It also makes the method signature more complex and harder to change in the future.

Keeping parameter lists short provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Methods with few parameters are easier to read and understand.
  Developers can quickly see what data the method needs without having to parse through a long list of parameters.
  Method calls become more concise and their intent becomes clearer.

- **Easier Testing**:
  Methods with fewer parameters require less setup in tests.
  Each parameter adds another dimension to the test matrix, making it harder to cover all combinations.
  Simpler parameter lists lead to simpler, more maintainable tests.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When a method has fewer parameters, it is easier to change its implementation without affecting callers.
  Adding or removing parameters from a method with many parameters requires updating all call sites, which is error-prone.
  Short parameter lists minimize this risk.

- **Reduced Error Risk**:
  With many parameters, especially of the same type, it is easy to pass arguments in the wrong order.
  This can lead to subtle bugs that are hard to detect.
  Fewer parameters reduce the chance of such mistakes.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  When related parameters are grouped into objects, the relationship between them becomes explicit.
  This makes the code more self-documenting and easier to understand.
  Parameter objects also provide a natural place to add validation and related behavior.

- **Better Encapsulation**:
  Methods with many parameters often indicate that the method is reaching into too many parts of the system.
  Reducing parameters encourages better encapsulation and clearer boundaries between components.
  This leads to more modular, maintainable code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, reduce the number of parameters. You can do this by:

- Creating a parameter object that groups related parameters together
- Using builder patterns for methods with many optional parameters
- Breaking the method into smaller methods with fewer parameters
- Using properties or fields to pass data when appropriate
- Reconsidering whether all parameters are truly necessary

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_0004
#pragma warning restore MiKo_0004
```
