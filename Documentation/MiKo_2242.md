# MiKo_2242: Use 'textual representation' instead of 'string representation' in documentation

## Cause

The documentation contains the phrase "string representation" instead of "textual representation".

## Rule description

Documentation should use "textual representation" instead of "string representation".

Developers care about the content being represented (the text), not the technical type (string).
This makes documentation clearer and more focused on what matters.

### Rationale behind

Using "textual representation" in documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Improved clarity**:
  The focus shifts from the technical implementation detail (the `string` type) to the actual purpose (representing something as text).
  This helps developers understand what the method or property does without getting distracted by type information.

- **Better readability**:
  Documentation becomes more natural to read.
  "Textual representation" sounds more like plain English, while "string representation" sounds overly technical.

- **Reduced cognitive load**:
  Developers can focus on the concept being represented rather than the data type.
  This is especially helpful when reading multiple pieces of documentation in succession.

- **Consistency with terminology**:
  The .NET Framework documentation often uses "textual representation" when describing conversion methods like `ToString()`.
  Following this convention creates consistency across the ecosystem.

## How to fix violations

Replace "string representation" with "textual representation" in the documentation.
