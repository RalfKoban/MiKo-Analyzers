# MiKo_3073: Fully initialize objects

## Cause

A constructor contains a return statement that exits before completing the initialization.

## Rule description

Avoid returning from within a constructor.
Constructors should execute fully, ensuring the objects are completely initialized.
Partial initialization can lead to unpredictable behavior and inconsistencies.

### Rationale behind

Constructors have a single responsibility: to fully initialize an object to a valid state.
When a constructor returns early, it can leave objects in an incomplete or invalid state, violating fundamental expectations about object construction.

Ensuring constructors fully execute provides several important benefits:

- **Guarantees Object Validity**:
  When constructors complete fully, all fields and properties are properly initialized.
  This ensures that objects are always in a valid, usable state after construction.

- **Prevents Subtle Bugs**:
  Early returns can leave some fields uninitialized or in default states that were not intended.
  These partially initialized objects can cause bugs that are difficult to diagnose because they appear to be valid instances.

- **Maintains Contract Expectations**:
  Callers expect that after a constructor completes, the object is ready to use.
  Partial initialization violates this contract and can lead to unexpected `NullReferenceException` or invalid state errors.

- **Improves Code Predictability**:
  When constructors always run to completion, developers can rely on the initialization logic being fully executed.
  This makes the code behavior more predictable and easier to reason about.

- **Simplifies Debugging**:
  When all initialization happens in one place without early exits, it is easier to trace through constructor logic and verify that objects are being created correctly.

- **Supports Inheritance Properly**:
  In inheritance hierarchies, early returns in base constructors can leave derived class initialization incomplete.
  This creates complex initialization issues that are difficult to track down.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the constructor to remove early return statements.
Use constructor parameters, guard clauses that throw exceptions, or factory methods to handle conditional initialization instead of returning early.
If an object cannot be created in certain conditions, throw an appropriate exception rather than returning early.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3073
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3073
```
