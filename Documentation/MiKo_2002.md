# MiKo_2002: Document `EventArgs` properly

## Cause

A class that inherits from `System.EventArgs` does not include the standard documentation phrase.

## Rule description

To make maintenance easier, classes inheriting from `System.EventArgs` should include documentation stating `Provides data for the <see cref="XYZ" /> event.`
This clarifies which event they relate to, ensuring the documentation is clear and helpful.

### Rationale behind

EventArgs classes serve a specific purpose: they carry data for events.
When `EventArgs` documentation follows a consistent pattern, developers can immediately understand which event the class supports and what kind of information it provides.

Using the standard documentation phrase provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Event Association**:
  The documentation explicitly links the `EventArgs` class to its corresponding event.
  Developers can quickly navigate between the event and its data class without searching through the codebase.

- **Framework Consistency**:
  The .NET Framework uses this exact pattern for all `EventArgs` classes.
  Following the same convention makes the code feel familiar and professional to developers who work with .NET.

- **Easier Navigation**:
  The `see cref` tag creates a clickable link to the related event in IntelliSense and generated documentation.
  This makes it easy to jump to the event definition and understand the full context.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  When `EventArgs` classes have clear, standardized documentation, there is no ambiguity about their purpose or usage.
  New developers can understand the relationship between events and their data immediately.

- **Better Maintenance**:
  Standardized documentation makes it easier to verify that events and their `EventArgs` classes are properly paired.
  This helps catch issues during code reviews and refactoring.

- **Simplified Learning**:
  Developers new to the codebase can rely on the consistent pattern to understand how events work throughout the application.
  They do not need to decipher different documentation styles for the same type of functionality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the `EventArgs` class documentation to use the standard phrase.

Write: `Provides data for the <see cref="EventName" /> event.` where *EventName* is replaced with the actual event that uses this `EventArgs` class.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2002
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2002
```
