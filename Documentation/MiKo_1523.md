# MiKo_1523: Do not name methods 'Helper'

## Cause

A method has a name that contains the terms 'Helper' or 'HelpingMethod'.

## Rule description

Method names should describe the specific behavior they provide, not label the method as a generic helper.

Names like 'Helper', 'HelpingMethod', or 'XxxHelper' are vague and add no meaningful semantic information. Whether a method "helps" is already implied by how and where it's used.

Using action‑oriented, descriptive names that communicate intent and effect makes the code clearer and easier to understand.

### Rationale behind

Generic names like 'Helper' provide no information about what a method actually does.
They make it difficult for developers to understand the purpose of a method without reading its implementation.

Avoiding vague helper names and using descriptive, action-oriented names provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Descriptive method names immediately tell what the method does.
  Developers can understand the code without having to dig into the implementation details.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When method names clearly describe their purpose, it is easier to find the right method when fixing bugs or adding features.
  This reduces the time spent searching through the codebase.

- **Enhanced Self-Documentation**:
  Action-oriented names make the code self-explanatory.
  Well-named methods reduce the need for additional comments and documentation.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Generic names like 'Helper' do not convey what the method actually helps with.
  Specific names eliminate ambiguity and make the code flow more logical.

- **Easier Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly understand what each method is supposed to do based on its name.
  This makes code reviews faster and more effective.

- **Better Code Organization**:
  Descriptive names encourage developers to think about what a method really does.
  This often leads to better separation of concerns and cleaner code structure.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the method to describe what it actually does.

Replace generic terms like 'Helper' with action verbs that explain the specific operation being performed.

For example:

- Instead of `StringHelper`, use `FormatString`, `ValidateInput`, or `ParseValue`
- Instead of `DataHelper`, use `LoadData`, `SaveRecord`, or `TransformData`
- Instead of `CalculationHelper`, use `ComputeTotal`, `CalculateDiscount`, or `SumValues`

Choose names that clearly communicate the method's intent and what it returns or modifies.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1523
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1523
```
