# MiKo_2218: Use shorter terms instead of `used to/in/by` in documentation

## Cause

The documentation contains wordy phrases like `that is used to`, `which shall be used to`, or similar constructions.

## Rule description

Phrases like `that is used to` or `which shall be used to` are unnecessarily wordy.
They should be shortened to the more concise term `to`.
This enhances readability and streamlines documentation, making it clearer and more direct for developers.

### Rationale behind

Wordy phrases add unnecessary length to documentation without adding meaning or clarity.
Phrases like `that is used to` can almost always be replaced with a single word like `to` without losing any information.

Concise documentation is easier to read and understand, especially when scanning through IntelliSense or reviewing multiple members.
Eliminating unnecessary words makes documentation more efficient and professional.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Shorter phrases communicate the same information with fewer words.

- **Better Readability**:
  Removing unnecessary words makes documentation easier to scan and understand.

- **Clearer Communication**:
  Direct language gets to the point more quickly than wordy constructions.

- **Professional Style**:
  Concise writing is a hallmark of good technical documentation.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  Developers can understand streamlined documentation more quickly while working.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace wordy phrases like `that is used to` or `which shall be used to` with the simpler term `to`.
