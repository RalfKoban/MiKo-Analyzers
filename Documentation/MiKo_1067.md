# MiKo_1067: Do not include `Perform` in method names

## Cause

A method name contains `Perform`.

## Rule description

The purpose of methods is to execute code, so it is useless and repetitive to have `Perform` in their names.

### Rationale behind

All methods perform actions by their very nature.
Adding `Perform` to a method name is redundant and adds no meaningful information.
It makes names longer without improving clarity, and actually makes the code less readable.

Removing `Perform` from method names provides several important benefits:

- **Concise Names**:
  Shorter method names are easier to read and type.
  Removing unnecessary words makes the code cleaner and more professional.

- **Clear Intent**:
  Without the redundant `Perform`, the actual action becomes more prominent.
  `Validate` is clearer than `PerformValidation` because it gets straight to the point.

- **Better Readability**:
  Code flows more naturally when method names are concise verbs.
  `Calculate the total` reads better than `Perform calculation of the total`.

- **Consistency**:
  Most well-designed APIs do not use `Perform` in method names.
  Following this pattern makes the code consistent with industry standards.

- **Reduced Noise**:
  Every unnecessary word in code adds cognitive load.
  Removing `Perform` helps developers focus on what actually matters.

- **Professional Quality**:
  Code without redundant words appears more polished and well-thought-out.
  It shows attention to naming conventions and code quality.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove `Perform` from the method name.
