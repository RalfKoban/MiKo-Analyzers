# MiKo_3225: Remove duplicate logical conditions

## Cause

A logical condition (using `||` or `&&`) contains the same sub-condition on both sides of the logical operator.

## Rule description

Logical expressions that repeat the same condition on both sides of a logical operator (`||` or `&&`) are redundant.
Simplify them by removing the duplicate condition.
This makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Rationale behind

Repeating the same condition in a logical expression always produces a predictable result and serves no meaningful purpose.
Such duplications often suggest a copy-paste error or unnecessary code that should be removed.

Simplifying duplicate logical conditions provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Removing duplicate conditions makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.
  Developers do not waste time trying to understand redundant logic.

- **Bug Detection**:
  Duplicate conditions often indicate copy-paste errors or logic mistakes.
  Identifying them helps uncover potential bugs where one side should have been a different condition.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Eliminating unnecessary duplications reduces cognitive load when reading code.
  The remaining logic becomes clearer and more focused.

- **Better Performance**:
  While compilers may optimize away duplicate conditions, removing them at the source level is clearer.
  It also ensures the code is efficient in all build configurations.

- **Enhanced Maintainability**:
  Code without redundant logic is easier to maintain and modify.
  Future developers will not be confused by duplicate conditions.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Simplified code communicates its purpose more directly.
  There is no ambiguity about what the code is trying to accomplish.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove one of the duplicate conditions, keeping only a single instance.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3225
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3225
```
