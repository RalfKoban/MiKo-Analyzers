# MiKo_1077: Do not suffix enum members with `Enum`

## Cause

An enum member name ends with `Enum`.

## Rule description

Indicating that an enum member is an enum member by using `Enum` as its suffix does not make sense.

### Rationale behind

Enum members are already part of an enum type, making the `Enum` suffix redundant and unnecessary.
The type system already provides all the information needed to know that a value is an enum member.

Adding `Enum` to member names creates verbose, awkward names that do not add any useful information.
It makes the code harder to read and write without providing any benefit.

This naming convention provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Removing redundant suffixes makes code cleaner and easier to read.
  Names are shorter and more focused on what the member represents, not its technical type.

- **Better Code Conciseness**:
  Shorter, more meaningful names make code more concise without losing clarity.
  Developers can write and read code faster.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Names that focus on what the member represents (like `Active` or `Inactive`) are more descriptive than names that focus on the technical detail that it is an enum.

- **Reduced Redundancy**:
  The type system already tells developers that a value is an enum member.
  Repeating this information in the name is unnecessary and clutters the code.

- **Consistent Conventions**:
  Standard .NET naming guidelines do not recommend adding type information to member names.
  Following this convention keeps code consistent with framework patterns.

- **Natural Language**:
  Without the `Enum` suffix, code reads more like natural language, making it more intuitive and approachable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `Enum` suffix from the enum member name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_1077
#pragma warning restore MiKo_1077
```
