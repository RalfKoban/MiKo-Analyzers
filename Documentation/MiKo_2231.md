# MiKo_2231: Use `<inheritdoc />` marker for overridden `GetHashCode()` methods documentation

## Cause

An overridden GetHashCode() method has custom documentation instead of using `<inheritdoc />`.

## Rule description

The main role of overridden `GetHashCode()` methods is to provide a hash code.
Therefore, there is no need to create separate documentation for them.
Instead, use the `<inheritdoc/>` marker to keep it simple and clean.
This ensures the method inherits the documentation from its base class, maintaining consistency and clarity.

### Rationale behind

The purpose of GetHashCode() is well-defined and standard across all implementations.
Custom documentation for overridden GetHashCode() methods typically repeats the same information that is already in the base documentation, adding no value.

Using `<inheritdoc />` for overridden GetHashCode() methods provides several important benefits:

- **Reduces Duplication**:
  The base class documentation already explains what GetHashCode() does.
  Repeating this information in every override wastes time and creates maintenance burden.

- **Maintains Consistency**:
  When documentation is inherited from the base class, all GetHashCode() implementations have consistent documentation.
  This makes the API more predictable and easier to understand.

- **Prevents Drift**:
  Custom documentation can become outdated or inconsistent with the base documentation over time.
  Using `<inheritdoc />` ensures the documentation always matches the standard definition.

- **Saves Development Time**:
  Developers do not need to write and maintain custom documentation for every GetHashCode() override.
  They can focus on documenting methods that have unique behavior.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  Using `<inheritdoc />` signals that the override follows the standard contract without special behavior.
  Custom documentation might make developers wonder if there is something unusual about this particular implementation.

- **Better Code Reviews**:
  Reviewers can quickly see that GetHashCode() implementations use standard documentation, allowing them to focus on more important aspects of the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace custom documentation on overridden GetHashCode() methods with `<inheritdoc />`.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2231
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2231
```
