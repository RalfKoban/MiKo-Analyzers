# MiKo_2030: Start return value documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A return value documentation does not start with a default phrase.

## Rule description

Documentation for a return value should start with a default phrase that provides a detailed description of what the returned value is.
This approach helps clarify the purpose and use of the return value for developers.

### Rationale behind

Return value documentation should start with a consistent phrase to make documentation more predictable and easier to read.
When developers encounter return value documentation that follows a consistent pattern, they can quickly understand what the method returns without having to parse different writing styles.

Following a standard format provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Clarity**:
  Starting return value documentation with a default phrase makes it immediately clear what the method returns.
  Developers do not need to read through varying descriptions to find the essential information.

- **Consistent Documentation**:
  Using a standard phrase across the codebase creates uniformity in documentation.
  This consistency makes the documentation feel more professional and reliable.

- **Faster Comprehension**:
  When all return value documentation follows the same pattern, developers can quickly scan through documentation and find the information they need.
  This saves time and reduces cognitive load.

- **Easier Maintenance**:
  Consistent documentation patterns are easier to maintain and update.
  When the documentation follows a predictable structure, it is simpler to review and ensure accuracy.

- **Better Tool Support**:
  Documentation tools and IntelliSense work better with consistently formatted documentation.
  This improves the overall development experience.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the return value documentation with an appropriate default phrase that describes what the method returns.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the type and purpose of the return value.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2030
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2030
```
