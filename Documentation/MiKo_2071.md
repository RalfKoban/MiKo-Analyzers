# MiKo_2071: Do not use boolean phrases in Enum return type `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The `<summary>` documentation for a method that returns an Enum type uses phrases that are meant for boolean return types.

## Rule description

`<summary>` documentation for methods returning Enum types should avoid phrases meant for boolean types.
Enum values are not booleans, so the documentation should not use terms like `indicates whether`, which imply a boolean context.
This ensures the documentation accurately reflects the nature of the Enum type.

### Rationale behind

Using boolean-oriented phrases for Enum return types creates confusion about what the method actually returns.
Phrases like `indicates whether` suggest a true or false answer, but Enums typically have multiple possible values that represent different states or options.

When documentation uses inappropriate phrases, it misleads developers about the return type and the range of possible values.
This can lead to incorrect assumptions and bugs in code that calls the method.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **Accurate Type Representation**:
  Documentation that matches the actual return type helps developers understand exactly what values to expect.

- **Reduced Confusion**:
  Avoiding boolean phrases for Enum returns prevents developers from mistakenly treating the return value as a simple true or false.

- **Better IntelliSense Experience**:
  Clear documentation helps developers make correct decisions when viewing method signatures in their IDE.

- **Improved Code Correctness**:
  When developers understand the actual return type, they are less likely to write incorrect code that mishandles Enum values.

- **Clearer Documentation**:
  Using appropriate language for Enum types makes the documentation more precise and professional.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace boolean-oriented phrases with language appropriate for Enum types.
Instead of `indicates whether`, use phrases like `gets`, `determines`, or `returns` followed by what the Enum represents.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2071
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2071
```
