# MiKo_6008: Precede using directives with blank lines

## Cause

Using directives for a specific namespace are not preceded with blank lines.

## Rule description

Precede using directives for a specific namespace with blank lines to visually separate them from using directives for other namespaces.
This improves readability and makes the code easier to follow.

### Rationale behind

Preceding using directives with blank lines is important for maintaining organized and readable code files.
Grouping related using directives together and separating different namespace groups with blank lines helps developers quickly understand the dependencies of a file and locate specific imports when needed.

Preceding using directives with blank lines provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Namespace Grouping**:
  Blank lines create visual groups of related using directives.
  This makes it easy to see which namespaces are from the same library or serve similar purposes.

- **Improved Organization**:
  Visual separation helps organize imports into logical categories.
  System namespaces, third-party libraries, and project-specific namespaces can be clearly distinguished.

- **Better Readability**:
  When using directives are grouped and separated, the file structure is easier to read.
  Developers can quickly scan through the imports without being overwhelmed by a long list.

- **Easier Dependency Management**:
  Separated groups make it easier to manage dependencies.
  Adding or removing using directives is simpler when they are organized into logical groups.

- **Quick Import Location**:
  When using directives are organized with blank lines, finding a specific import is faster.
  Developers can navigate to the appropriate group rather than scanning through an unsorted list.

- **Better Code Review**:
  During code reviews, organized using directives are easier to verify.
  Reviewers can quickly check that appropriate namespaces are imported and unnecessary imports are removed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add blank lines to separate using directives from different namespace groups.
Group related namespaces together and use blank lines to visually separate different groups.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_6008
#pragma warning restore MiKo_6008
```
