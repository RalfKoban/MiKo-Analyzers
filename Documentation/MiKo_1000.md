# MiKo_1000: Suffix `System.EventArgs` types with `EventArgs`

## Cause

A type that inherits from `System.EventArgs` does not have a name ending with `EventArgs`.

## Rule description

To maintain consistency and clarity in code, event argument types should inherit from `System.EventArgs` and their names should end with `EventArgs`.

This naming convention makes it immediately clear that a type is used for event data.
It follows the standard .NET Framework Design Guidelines and helps developers quickly identify event-related types in the codebase.

When creating custom event data, the type name should clearly indicate its purpose by ending with `EventArgs`.

### Rationale behind

Suffixing `EventArgs` types with `EventArgs` is a fundamental .NET naming convention that provides instant recognition of a type's purpose.
This pattern is used consistently throughout the .NET Framework (e.g., `MouseEventArgs`, `PropertyChangedEventArgs`, `EventArgs` itself), creating a universal expectation among .NET developers.

When a type follows this convention, developers immediately understand that it carries event-specific data without needing to examine its declaration or documentation.
This naming pattern enables better code organization and discoverability.
When browsing through IntelliSense or searching through code, all event argument types are easily identifiable and grouped together alphabetically.

Following this standard provides several important benefits:

- **Instant Recognition**:
  The `EventArgs` suffix immediately signals a type's purpose.
  Developers can identify event data types at a glance without examining their base class or documentation.

- **Improved Discoverability**:
  All event argument types appear together when sorted alphabetically.
  This grouping makes it easier to find related event types when browsing through a codebase or using IntelliSense.

- **Consistency with the Framework**:
  The .NET Framework uses this pattern universally.
  Following the same convention makes custom code feel integrated with platform standards.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
  Consistent naming patterns reduce the mental effort required to understand code.
  Developers do not need to learn or remember different naming schemes for event data types.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  When all event argument types follow the same naming pattern, the codebase becomes more predictable and easier to maintain.
  New team members can quickly learn and apply the established pattern.

- **Professional Code Quality**:
  Adhering to established best practices and Microsoft's official design guidelines signals that the code is well-designed and professionally maintained.
  Deviating from this convention can make the codebase feel inconsistent or poorly designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the type to end with `EventArgs`.
