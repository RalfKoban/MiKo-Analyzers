# MiKo_2306: End comments with a period

## Cause

An inline comment does not end with a period.

## Rule description

Inline comments are meant for team members, not for API documentation.
They should deliver important information concisely but still be complete sentences.
This helps maintain clarity and effective communication within the team.

This rule contradicts MiKo_2303.

### Rationale behind

The question of whether to end comments with periods is a stylistic choice that teams must decide.
Some teams prefer brief, fragmentary comments without periods, while others prefer complete sentences with proper punctuation.
This rule supports the complete sentence style.

Ending comments with periods provides several benefits for teams that prefer this style:

- **Enforces Complete Thoughts**:
  Requiring periods encourages developers to write complete, well-formed sentences.
  This leads to clearer and more informative comments.

- **Professional Appearance**:
  Complete sentences with proper punctuation appear more professional and carefully written.
  This reflects positively on overall code quality.

- **Better Readability**:
  Complete sentences are easier to read and understand than fragments.
  Proper punctuation provides clear visual cues about where thoughts end.

- **Consistent with Documentation**:
  When comments follow the same punctuation rules as documentation, the codebase has a more consistent feel.
  This makes it easier to move between code and documentation.

- **Clear Communication**:
  Complete sentences communicate ideas more clearly than fragments.
  They force developers to articulate thoughts fully.

- **Team Convention**:
  Following a consistent team convention, whether it includes periods or not, is more important than the specific choice.
  This rule helps enforce one such convention.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add a period at the end of inline comments to form complete sentences.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2306
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2306
```
