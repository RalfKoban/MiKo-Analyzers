# MiKo_3007: Do not mix LINQ method and declarative query syntax in same method

## Cause

A method contains both LINQ method syntax and LINQ declarative query syntax.

## Rule description

To improve maintainability and readability, stick to a single language when writing methods.
Avoid mixing LINQ method syntax with declarative query syntax within the same method.
This practice ensures consistency, making the code clean, easier to read, and more straightforward to maintain.

### Rationale behind

Mixing LINQ method syntax with declarative query syntax creates inconsistent code that is harder to read and understand.
Each syntax has its own mental model, and switching between them within the same method increases cognitive load.

Using a consistent LINQ syntax provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Readability**:
  Code that follows a single syntax style is easier to scan and comprehend.
  Developers do not need to switch mental models while reading the method.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Consistent syntax makes it easier to modify queries.
  Developers can apply the same patterns and techniques throughout the method.

- **Reduced Complexity**:
  Each LINQ syntax has its strengths for different scenarios.
  Mixing them suggests the query might be too complex and should be refactored.

- **Easier Code Review**:
  Reviewers can focus on the logic rather than being distracted by syntax inconsistencies.
  This leads to more effective reviews and better quality.

- **Clearer Intent**:
  A consistent syntax style communicates that the operations are part of a unified data transformation.
  Mixing styles can suggest they are separate concerns that might benefit from being split.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the method to use either LINQ method syntax or declarative query syntax consistently throughout.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_3007
#pragma warning restore MiKo_3007
```
