# MiKo_2079: Do not include obvious text in property `<summary>` documentation

## Cause

The property `<summary>` documentation contains obvious text that merely repeats that the property gets or sets a value.

## Rule description

Comments that merely state the name of a property and that it gets or sets provide no meaningful information.
Such redundant comments should be removed to keep the code clean and focused on more valuable insights.
Clear and concise documentation improves overall readability and maintenance.

### Rationale behind

Property documentation that simply states "Gets or sets the value" or similar phrases adds no value beyond what is already obvious from the property declaration itself.
Developers can see from the code whether a property has a getter, setter, or both.

Documentation should provide insight into what the property represents, how it is used, or any important constraints or behaviors.
Repeating obvious information wastes time for both the writer and the reader.

Following this rule provides several important benefits:

- **More Meaningful Documentation**:
  Focusing on the purpose and meaning of properties makes documentation actually useful for developers.

- **Reduced Noise**:
  Eliminating redundant comments makes it easier to find and read documentation that provides real value.

- **Better Maintainability**:
  Less documentation means less to maintain when code changes, and the remaining documentation is more likely to stay accurate.

- **Improved Code Quality**:
  Encouraging meaningful documentation leads to better thought about what each property represents.

- **Time Savings**:
  Developers do not waste time reading or writing comments that provide no information beyond the code itself.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, either remove the redundant documentation or replace it with meaningful information about what the property represents and how it should be used.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2079
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2079
```
