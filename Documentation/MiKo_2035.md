# MiKo_2035: Start collection return value documentation with default phrase

## Cause

A collection return value documentation does not start with a default phrase.

## Rule description

The documentation of a collection as return value should have a specific phrase that clearly describes what the collection contains.

### Rationale behind

Collection return values contain multiple items, and their documentation needs to clearly explain what type of items the collection holds and what they represent.
Using a consistent starting phrase helps developers quickly understand the contents and purpose of the returned collection.

Following a standard format for collection return value documentation provides several important benefits:

- **Clear Collection Contents**:
  Starting collection documentation with a specific phrase makes it immediately clear what items the collection contains.
  Developers can quickly understand the type and purpose of the collection elements.

- **Consistent Documentation Pattern**:
  Using a standard phrase for collection return values creates uniformity across the codebase.
  This consistency helps developers quickly locate and understand methods that return collections.

- **Better Understanding of Items**:
  Documenting what the collection contains helps developers understand the structure and content of the returned data.
  This is crucial for properly iterating over and processing collection items.

- **Reduced Errors**:
  Clear documentation of collection contents reduces the likelihood of errors when consuming the collection.
  Developers can see exactly what type of items to expect and how to handle them.

- **Improved Code Quality**:
  When collection documentation is clear, developers can write better code that properly handles the returned data.
  This improves the overall quality and reliability of the codebase.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, start the collection return value documentation with a specific phrase that describes what items the collection contains.
Ensure the phrase clearly explains the type and purpose of the collection elements.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable MiKo_2035
#pragma warning restore MiKo_2035
