# MiKo_2307: Use phrase `failed` instead of `was not successful` in comments

## Cause

A comment contains the wordy phrase `was not successful` instead of the simpler `failed`.

## Rule description

To make comments concise and precise, use `failed` instead of `was not successful`.
This keeps it brief and straight to the point, making it easier for developers to understand quickly.

### Rationale behind

The phrase `was not successful` uses four words to express what `failed` expresses in one.
This verbosity makes comments longer and harder to read without adding any additional meaning.

Using `failed` instead of `was not successful` provides several important benefits:

- **Improved Conciseness**:
  Replacing four words with one makes comments much more concise.
  Developers can read and understand the information faster.

- **Clearer Communication**:
  `Failed` is direct and unambiguous.
  It clearly states that something did not work without softening or obscuring the message.

- **Faster Reading**:
  Shorter comments are processed more quickly by readers.
  Every unnecessary word slows down comprehension.

- **More Impactful**:
  `Failed` is a stronger, clearer word than `was not successful`.
  It better conveys the seriousness of the situation.

- **Consistent Style**:
  Using concise language throughout comments creates a consistent, professional style.
  This makes the codebase easier to work with.

- **Better Focus**:
  Concise comments help developers focus on the actual information being conveyed.
  Wordy phrases distract from the core message.
