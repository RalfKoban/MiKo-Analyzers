# MiKo_2222: Use term `identification` instead of `ident` in documentation

## Cause

XML documentation contains the abbreviation `ident` instead of the full term `identification`.

## Rule description

XML documentation should avoid the abbreviation `ident` and instead use the term `identification`.
This ensures clarity and precision, making the documentation more understandable and professional.
Clear terminology helps prevent confusion and enhances readability for developers.

### Rationale behind

Abbreviations like `ident` create ambiguity and can confuse readers, especially those who are not familiar with the specific domain or context.
The term `identification` is universally understood and leaves no room for misinterpretation.

Using the full term `identification` provides several important benefits:

- **Eliminates Ambiguity**:
  `Ident` could mean identification, identifier, identity, indentation, or other related concepts.
  Using the complete term removes any guesswork about the intended meaning.

- **Improves Accessibility**:
  Not all developers are native English speakers or familiar with common abbreviations in a specific domain.
  Using complete words makes documentation accessible to a wider audience.

- **Enhances Professional Quality**:
  Complete, unabbreviated terms make documentation appear more polished and professional.
  This reflects positively on the overall code quality.

- **Better Search and Discovery**:
  When developers search for `identification` in documentation or code, they will find all relevant instances.
  Abbreviations can fragment search results and make it harder to find related information.

- **Reduces Cognitive Load**:
  Readers do not need to pause and mentally expand abbreviations while reading.
  This makes documentation faster and easier to consume.

- **Prevents Misunderstandings**:
  Clear, complete terminology ensures that all team members understand the documentation the same way, reducing miscommunication and errors.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the abbreviation `ident` with the full term `identification` in the documentation.
